      "8. \"Redundant state variable assignments.\" It refers to the pattern where a state variable is assigned the same value, both inside and outside of a conditional statement, regardless of the outcome of the condition. Such assignments can be moved outside the conditional block to save gas. In the given code, we can see that `lockedBy = NOT_LOCKED_FLAG;` is being assigned in both branches of the `if (msg.sender != address(this))` statement in the `isNotLocked()` modifier.

In the given code, the `map()` function uses three separate conditions to decide the recipient address.

This way, there is no need to compare the recipient with `Constants.ADDRESS_THIS` in the `map` function.\n",

      "8. Eliminating unnecessary address comparisons is indeed a good approach to save gas, as these operations consume resources. Directly using `msg.sender` and `recipient` is a more efficient approach, and delegating the recipient checking logic to the calling function, as you mentioned, may further streamline the process.\n",

      "\n",
      "8. \"Redundant state variable initial value.\" In the contract LockAndMsgSender, the state variable `lockedBy` is initialized with the value `NOT_LOCKED_FLAG`. However, this is redundant since Solidity automatically initializes state variables to their default values. In this case, the default value for the `address` type is `address(0)`. Assigning `NOT_LOCKED_FLAG` address(1) and initializing `lockedBy` with it is an unnecessary gas-consuming operation. To save gas, initialize the `lockedBy` variable directly with its desired value or set the `NOT_LOCKED_FLAG` to `address(0)` and remove the initialization of the `lockedBy` variable.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. \"Unoptimized conditional branching.\" The modifier `isNotLocked` uses nested `if` statements to check whether the contract is locked by the `msg.sender` and whether the current sender is not the contract itself. These two conditions could be checked with logic AND operation, simplifying the code and saving gas by reducing branching complexity. Instead of the nested conditionals, the updated code could look like:\n",

A more optimal solution would be to utilize a break statement or design the loop to execute the least number of iterations possible.\n",

      "2. Excessive storage: Storing unnecessary data or storing redundant data in multiple variables consumes more gas.

      "\n",
      "3. Suboptimal use of functions: Calling multiple external functions or having overly complex nested function call structures may result in higher gas usage. It's better to minimize external function calls (especially to other contracts) and, where possible, use internal functions.\n",

      "4. Inefficient use of modifiers: Using modifiers with redundant or repetitive code can unnecessarily increase gas costs. It's essential to avoid code duplication and instead use a well-structured solution to minimize gas consumption.\n",

      "5. Unused variables: Declaring variables that are never used in the contract will consume gas, so it's essential to remove any unused variables.\n",

      "7. Inefficient use of mapping: Mapping with non-unique keys or keys that result in collisions may lead to unnecessary gas spending. Ensuring that keys are unique along with using tightly-packed structs can help reduce gas costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. Overusing the 'require' statement: In some cases, using too many 'require' statements can cause excessive gas usage if there are multiple checks running with overlapping conditions. It's better to consolidate validation checks and use 'assert' when appropriate.\n",

      "9. Inefficient use of arithmetic operations: Utilizing the '**' (power) operator or the modulus operator '%' excessively may consume more gas. It is crucial to consider optimizing the arithmetic operations whenever possible.\n",

      "***PROMPT: I want you to help me find new gas-wasting patterns for Solidity at the source code level. To help you accomplish this task, I will give you two types of information, namely a list of known gas-wasting patterns as a few-shot example for you, as well as a chunk of source codes from deployed Solidity codes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before giving you the information, I want to tell you a high-level idea of gas optimization. Each instruction in the code sequence consumes a certain amount of gas based on their operation types, which costs money. If we could find an equivalent code instruction sequence that produces the same output while consuming less gas, then this would save money for Solidity users.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the list of known gas-wasting patterns are given below. The list is numbered, with each bullet point specifying one gas-wasting pattern, which is followed by an explanation of why this pattern wastes gas. I want you to read through these and learn how to find new gas-wasting patterns from it. The list is as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. \"dead codes.\" Defined explicitly as codes that are guaranteed not to be executed during runtime. One example would be a conditional branch that would never be reached. \n",
      "\n",
      "2. \"Opaque predicate.\" The outcome of an opaque predicate could be obviously inferred to be true or false without execution. As a result, the corresponding predicate check (e.g. if statement) could be removed to save computations during runtime. Note that the main idea of saving gas here is that simplifying the codes before deploying them does not cost gas, while if deployed codes have any inefficiency, then gas would be wasted due to runtime execution.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. \"Expensive operations in a loop.\" It refers to the pattern where expensive operations (in terms of gas consumption for Solidity smart contracts) are executed multiple times in a loop, but such expensive operations could be moved out of the loop such that they executed less number of times, without affecting the functionality of the codes. \n",
      "\n",
      "4. \"Constant outcome of a loop.\" It refers to the pattern where the outcome of a loop may be a constant that can be inferred during compilation. Evaluating to this constant during runtime would cost gas and is therefore a waste of gas, since we could just replace it with the constant before deployment and save the gas used in the loop.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. \"Loop fusion.\" It refers to the pattern where there are several separate loops which could be combined into one, without changing the functionality. This has the benefit of reducing gas, in the sense that it can reduce the number of operations, such as conditional jumps and comparison, etc., at the entry points of loops. \n",
      "\n",
      "6. \"Repeated computations in a loop.\" It refers to the pattern where there are expressions that produce the same outcome in each iteration of a loop. Hence, the gas can be saved by computing\n",
      "the outcome once and then reusing the value instead of recomputing it in subsequent iterations, especially for expressions involving expensive operands. To save gas, this repeated computation could be done before the loop, and then the result could be reused within the loop.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. \"Comparison with unilateral outcome in a loop.\" It refers to the pattern where a comparison is executed in each iteration of a loop, but the result of the comparison is the same even if it cannot\n",
      "be determined during compilation (e.g. a repeated comparison in the loop whose result depends on the runtime input). To save gas, this repeated comparison could be moved out of the loop, and then the result could be reused within the loop.\n",

      "Next, I will give you a chunk of Solidity codes, and I want you to help me find gas-wasting patterns similar to the list given above.

      "\n",
      "8. \"Redundant state variable initial value.\" In the contract LockAndMsgSender, the state variable `lockedBy` is initialized with the value `NOT_LOCKED_FLAG`. However, this is redundant since Solidity automatically initializes state variables to their default values. In this case, the default value for the `address` type is `address(0)`. Assigning `NOT_LOCKED_FLAG` address(1) and initializing `lockedBy` with it is an unnecessary gas-consuming operation. To save gas, initialize the `lockedBy` variable directly with its desired value or set the `NOT_LOCKED_FLAG` to `address(0)` and remove the initialization of the `lockedBy` variable.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. \"Unoptimized conditional branching.\" The modifier `isNotLocked` uses nested `if` statements to check whether the contract is locked by the `msg.sender` and whether the current sender is not the contract itself. These two conditions could be checked with logic AND operation, simplifying the code and saving gas by reducing branching complexity. Instead of the nested conditionals, the updated code could look like:\n",
