Here is the combined, concise, and improved list of gas-wasting patterns in Solidity after incorporating the expert's feedback:

1. **Redundant storage access**: Reduce multiple storage accesses for the same variable in a single function by using a local variable to store the accessed value.

2. **Repeated function calls**: Optimize functions with multiple calls and identical outputs by introducing internal loops, if the gas-saving benefits outweigh the added complexity.

3. **Excessive use of assembly language**: Use appropriate Solidity language features over assembly code, taking into account the trade-offs between gas savings, code complexity, and contract functionality.

4. **Inefficient if-else statements**: Refactor code to a more efficient control flow structure, such as a binary search, for a large number of commands, considering the trade-offs between gas savings and code complexity.

5. **Unnecessary opcode**: Reduce or eliminate unnecessary opcodes, such as redundant address checks, if they do not compromise contract functionality or security.

6. **Using call with predefined addresses**: Optimize contract interactions by creating contract interfaces and invoking functions directly on contract instances instead of using raw `call` function to save gas and improve readability.

7. **Large arrays/loops**: Minimize loops that iterate over large arrays. Consider alternatives such as pagination or breaking up operations across multiple transactions.

8. **Unoptimized libraries or math operations**: Use optimized library functions or implement optimizations to reduce gas usage for mathematical operations.

9. **Inefficient event logging**: Simplify event logs by logging only necessary information to minimize gas consumption.

10. **Fallback functions without "view" or "pure" specifiers**: Mark functions that do not modify contract state with "view" or "pure" specifiers to reduce gas usage for read-only operations.

11. **Using loops for array initialization**: Avoid loops for array initialization. Use the "push" method or initialize the array with a fixed size when possible.

12. **Unoptimized struct packing**: Optimize struct packing techniques and variable ordering to save gas when storing data in a contract.

13. **Unnecessary external calls**: Minimize the number of external contract calls. Prefer internal calls or local operations whenever possible.

Always analyze your contract code thoroughly and consider all trade-offs before implementing these patterns. Remember to prioritize contract security and maintainability over gas optimization and perform extensive testing to ensure correct functionality and actual gas savings.
