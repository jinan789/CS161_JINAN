Your high-level explanation of gas optimization in Solidity is correct. Reducing the gas consumption of a smart contract can save money for its users.

Regarding the gas-wasting patterns you described:

8. "Redundant state variable assignments." Your explanation and proposed changes for this pattern are correct. Removing the redundant state variable assignments and placing them outside the conditional block can help save gas.

```solidity
modifier isNotLocked() {
    if (msg.sender != address(this)) {
        if (lockedBy != NOT_LOCKED_FLAG) revert ContractLocked();
        lockedBy = msg.sender;
        _;
    } else {
        _;
    }
    lockedBy = NOT_LOCKED_FLAG;
}
```

9. "Inefficient recipient handling." Your description of this pattern is also accurate. Optimizing the conditions when deciding the recipient address can potentially save gas. We can illustrate a more efficient implementation with a custom structure and optimized if-else branching.

Suppose we have a mapping of recipients and their respective conditions as follows:

```solidity
mapping(address => Recipient) public recipients;

struct Recipient {
    uint256 condition1;
    uint256 condition2;
    uint256 condition3;
}
```

The original `map()` function implementation might look like:

```solidity
function map(address _recipient) public {
    if (recipients[_recipient].condition1 > 0) {
        recipients[_recipient].condition1--;
    } else if (recipients[_recipient].condition2 > 0) {
        recipients[_recipient].condition2--;
    } else if (recipients[_recipient].condition3 > 0) {
        recipients[_recipient].condition3--;
    }
}
```

An optimized implementation may directly access the specific condition value for decrement:

```solidity
function map(address _recipient, uint256 _conditionId) public {
    require(_conditionId >= 1 && _conditionId <= 3, "Invalid condition id");
    require(conditionValue(_recipient, _conditionId) > 0, "Condition value is zero");

    if (_conditionId == 1) {
        recipients[_recipient].condition1--;
    } else if (_conditionId == 2) {
        recipients[_recipient].condition2--;
    } else {
        recipients[_recipient].condition3--;
    }
}

function conditionValue(address _recipient, uint256 _conditionId) private view returns (uint256) {
    if (_conditionId == 1) {
        return recipients[_recipient].condition1;
    } else if (_conditionId == 2) {
        return recipients[_recipient].condition2;
    } else {
        return recipients[_recipient].condition3;
    }
}
```

This approach can be more efficient, as it directly accesses and decrements the specific condition value.

In summary, your understanding of these gas optimization patterns seems appropriate, and your suggestions for improvements are valid. By providing concise examples and explanations, you can help ensure that the specific changes or alternative approaches are clearly conveyed to improve gas optimization.
