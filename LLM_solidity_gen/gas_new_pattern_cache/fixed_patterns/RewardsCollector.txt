Based on the feedback from the expert, it seems that the identified gas-wasting pattern "Suboptimal function call" is correct and helpful for Solidity users to optimize their smart contracts and save gas costs. The provided alternative code using a high-level function call also offers a more gas-efficient and readable approach.

Therefore, the gas-wasting pattern can be presented as follows:

8. "Suboptimal function call." It refers to the pattern where a function call is made with a low-level .call() method instead of using a more explicit and gas-efficient high-level function call. This forces the code to unnecessarily check the correctness of the call during runtime and propagate success or failure, increasing gas costs.

Example of gas-wasting code:

```solidity
(bool success,) = LOOKS_RARE_REWARDS_DISTRIBUTOR.call(looksRareClaim);
if (!success) revert UnableToClaim();
```

Improved code using a high-level function call:

```solidity
try LOOKS_RARE_REWARDS_DISTRIBUTOR.distribute(looksRareClaim) {
    // ...
} catch {
    revert UnableToClaim();
}
```

By using a high-level function call instead of the low-level .call() method, the code becomes more explicit and efficient in terms of gas consumption.

The feedback from the expert confirms that the pattern is beneficial and there is no need for further improvements or changes. This gas-wasting pattern is helpful for Solidity users to optimize their smart contracts and save on gas costs.

Based on the feedback from the expert, here is an improved version of the gas-wasting pattern you found:

8. "Unnecessary event emission." The event, `RewardsSent`, is emitted in the `collectRewards` function, providing an amount of transferred tokens.

While having an event can be beneficial for monitoring and logging purposes, emitting an event also consumes gas. If the event information is not crucial for the contract's primary use case, or if it's already available through other means (e.g., through frontend web3 calls), then emitting the event could be considered a potential waste of gas.

In this particular case, the `RewardsSent` event is only providing the amount of transferred tokens. The token transfer information is usually already available in the blockchain transaction logs. Therefore, emitting the `RewardsSent` event might not be necessary, and the gas spent on emitting the event could potentially be saved.

However, it's important to note that optimizing gas usage might not always be the top priority for some developers, as events might be useful for monitoring and logging purposes, or for an intended usage of the contract. Therefore, it's essential to consider the specific requirements of the contract and weigh the benefits and drawbacks of including the event before deciding whether to remove it for the sake of gas optimization.

Additionally, to ensure a thorough understanding of other gas-wasting patterns and optimization techniques, you may want to explore more Solidity code or consult with a Solidity expert for further discussion. Nonetheless, for the specific pattern you've mentioned, your analysis is accurate, and the considerations you've raised will be valuable for those aiming to minimize gas fees when possible.

Based on the expert's feedback, your high-level understanding of gas optimization and the pattern you've identified are both accurate and valuable for optimizing gas usage in Solidity code. So, there is no need to make additional corrections to the patterns you've found.

For clarity, here is the improved version of the "Suboptimal use of the 'call' function" pattern, which includes the suggested changes that optimize gas usage:

1. "Suboptimal use of the 'call' function": Replace the 'call' function with a Solidity interface to save gas and make the code more straightforward and easy to use. Instead of passing data as a byte array with 'call', create an interface for the contract to interact with, ensuring the correct types are used.

To apply this optimization:

a) Create an interface for the contract:

```solidity
interface ILooksRareRewardsDistributor {
    function claimRewards(bytes calldata claimData) external;
}
```

b) Update the function to use the interface:

```solidity
function collectRewards(bytes calldata looksRareClaim) external {
    ILooksRareRewardsDistributor(LOOKS_RARE_REWARDS_DISTRIBUTOR).claimRewards(looksRareClaim);

    uint256 balance = LOOKS_RARE_TOKEN.balanceOf(address(this));
    LOOKS_RARE_TOKEN.transfer(ROUTER_REWARDS_DISTRIBUTOR, balance);
    emit RewardsSent(balance);
}
```

By using an interface instead of the 'call' function, your code becomes more gas-efficient, easier to read, and more type-safe.

The expert's feedback confirms the correctness and usefulness of this pattern for improving code quality and optimizing gas costs in Solidity.

Here is the improved version of the gas-wasting patterns incorporating the feedback provided by the expert:

1. "Unnecessary event emission." It refers to the pattern where an event is emitted but may not be required for the smart contract functionality, such as for tracking purposes only. Emitting events consumes gas; therefore, if the emitted event could be removed or replaced by a more efficient way of tracking, gas usage could be reduced. In the provided code:

```solidity
event RewardsSent(uint256 amount);

...
uint256 balance = LOOKS_RARE_TOKEN.balanceOf(address(this));
LOOKS_RARE_TOKEN.transfer(ROUTER_REWARDS_DISTRIBUTOR, balance);
emit RewardsSent(balance);
```

The `RewardsSent` event is emitted every time the `collectRewards` function is called. If this event is only used for tracking purposes and no other functionality requires this event to be emitted, reducing or removing the event emission would save gas. A more efficient way of tracking, such as periodically querying the contract state or utilizing off-chain tools, could be considered as an alternative.

It's important to note that events can be crucial for some applications to track changes in contract state, so removing or optimizing event emissions should be approached with caution, considering the impact on the overall system and potential trade-offs.

I hope this improved version of the patterns helps in identifying inefficiencies in Solidity code and provides possible solutions to reduce gas costs. Keep in mind that it's crucial to consider the specific context of the smart contract to prioritize proper functionality over gas optimization when making any changes.

First, let me provide the improved and corrected patterns based on the expert's feedback. The corrected gas-wasting patterns are given below. Each point specifies one gas-wasting pattern, followed by an explanation of why this pattern wastes gas and how it can be improved:

1. Unoptimized looping: Looping through an array or mapping in Solidity can result in high gas consumption if not implemented efficiently. This may occur due to unnecessary iterations or utilizing a for loop instead of the 'break' statement when an early exit is possible. To optimize the looping, consider using the 'break' statement or other early exit mechanisms when possible to reduce iterations and gas consumption.

2. Large array storage or data storage: Storing large amounts of data on the Ethereum blockchain can be costly in terms of gas. Saving large arrays or data structures within smart contracts can lead to gas wastage. To improve data storage efficiency, consider using off-chain storage solutions, smaller data structures, or data compression techniques to reduce the overall storage needs and save gas.

3. Unnecessary function calls: Excessive function calls within a smart contract can increase gas consumption. Contracts should be designed to minimize internal and external function call usage. To optimize function calls, evaluate the necessity of each call and consider combining multiple function calls into one or using events to reduce the overall number of calls.

4. Using complex arithmetic operations: Performing complex math operations within a smart contract, such as exponentiation or floating-point calculations, could consume a significant amount of gas. To optimize arithmetic operations, consider using simpler alternatives or built-in functions like addmod and mulmod to perform modular arithmetic more efficiently.

5. Unoptimized library usage: Including unnecessary libraries or functions from libraries can lead to increased gas costs for deployment. To optimize library usage, import only the functions that are needed and avoid including entire libraries if only a few functions are required. This will help reduce gas costs for deployment and the overall contract size.

6. Redundant state variable updates: Updating state variables repeatedly without the need for data consistency throughout can consume extra gas. Limiting state variable updates to only when they are necessary can help minimize gas wastage. To optimize state variable updates, evaluate when they are necessary and group updates inside the same function or transaction to avoid repeated update costs.

7. Excessive use of global variables: Using global variables indiscriminately can result in higher gas consumption. Local variables and storage pointers are generally more gas-efficient. To optimize global variable usage, assess their necessity and consider using local variables or storage pointers when possible to reduce gas consumption.

8. Inefficient use of external/native function calls: Solidity supports several native functions, such as keccak256 and sha3 for hashing. However, for some of these functions, native EVM functions might be more gas-efficient to use (e.g., using the assembly for bitwise manipulation). To optimize external or native function calls, analyze their gas efficiency and use the most gas-efficient version available, while maintaining good programming practices and security.

After incorporating the expert's feedback, these corrected patterns should be more applicable, generalizable, and usable for Solidity developers aiming to optimize gas usage within their smart contracts.
