Based on the suggestions provided, here's the improved and optimized version of the Solidity function `borrowAllowed`:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.5.16;

import "./ComptrollerInterface.sol";
import "./ComptrollerStorage.sol";
import "./ErrorReporter.sol";

contract BorrowAllowed is ComptrollerV2Storage, ComptrollerErrorReporter {
    
    // Check if the account is allowed to borrow the underlying asset of a given market
    function borrowAllowed(
        address cToken,
        address borrower,
        uint256 borrowAmount
    ) external view returns (uint) {
        Market storage market = markets[cToken];

        // Check if borrowing is paused by the borrow guardian contract
        if (market.borrowGuardianPaused) {
            return fail(Error.MARKET_BORROW_PAUSED, FailureInfo.BORROW_PAUSED);
        }

        // Optional: Add additional conditions for borrowing here

        // Return 0 if no error
        return uint(Error.NO_ERROR);
    }
}
```

Changes made:

1. Changed the visibility of the function `borrowAllowed` from `public` to `external` to save gas since this function is probably only called from external contracts.
2. Changed the variable `market` from `memory` to `storage` as using memory might require unnecessary copying of data.
