- Missing function visibility for constructor, it should be explicitly marked as "public".
- The contract should include the interfaces for cTokenBorrowed and cTokenCollateral contracts, in order to interact with them properly, as well as ensure the input addresses are of those contract types.
- import "./ErrorReporter.sol" should be updated to "import { ComptrollerErrorReporter } from './ErrorReporter.sol';" to specify the import of ComptrollerErrorReporter.
- There is no validation of repayAmount, which could lead to error scenarios.
- No test cases/modifiers for checking if caller is authorized to perform the required liquidation.
- Assumption that comptroller.checkMarketsListed and comptroller.liquidateCalculateSeizeTokens will not revert is not safe; consider using try-catch statements when calling external contract functions to handle exceptions gracefully.
- It's better to emit proper events in cases of failure or success in this function, so that the dApp can listen to these events and react accordingly.
- The function can benefit from adding proper natspec comments to describe its purpose and usage, including descriptions for the parameters, and expected output.
