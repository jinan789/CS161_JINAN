Given the limitations of the Assistant, I am unable to analyze chunks of Solidity code directly. However, I can provide you with additional potential gas-wasting patterns that you can look for in your code. Here are three more patterns to consider:

8. "Redundant variable assignments." This pattern occurs when a variable's value is assigned multiple times in different locations, but the previous assignments are not used or overwritten before being accessed. This wastes gas because each assignment consumes gas. To optimize, eliminate unnecessary assignments and use temporary variables if needed.

Example:

```solidity
function example() public {
    uint256 a = 5;
    a = 10;
    a = 20;
    doSomething(a);
}
```

In this example, the value of `a` is set to 5, then 10, and finally 20, without being accessed in between. The first two assignments can be removed to save gas.

9. "Unnecessary storage variables." This pattern occurs when a contract-level storage variable is used for temporary data that could be scoped to the function level. Storage is more expensive than memory in terms of gas consumption, so avoid using storage variables for temporary data.

Example:

```solidity
contract Example {
    uint256 public results;

    function calculate(uint256 a, uint256 b) public {
        results = a * b;
        // ... some code using results ...
    }
}
```

In this example, the contract-level storage variable `results` can be replaced with a function-level memory variable:

```solidity
contract Example {
    function calculate(uint256 a, uint256 b) public {
        uint256 results = a * b;
        // ... some code using results ...
    }
}
```

10. "Inefficient use of modifiers." Modifiers in Solidity can be abused to execute common code, leading to gas waste. Ensure that you only use modifiers for access control or other essential checks and avoid placing complex, gas-consuming logic inside them.

Example:

```solidity
contract Example {
    modifier expensiveModifier() {
        // ... some expensive computations ...
        _;
    }

    function func1() public expensiveModifier { }
    function func2() public expensiveModifier { }
}
```

In this example, each function call would trigger the expensive computations inside the `expensiveModifier`. It is better to move the expensive computations into separate helper functions and call them only when necessary.

Keep in mind that these patterns serve as guidelines to identify possible gas-wasting scenarios, but some cases might not be applicable depending on the specific requirements of the code. Always evaluate the impact of each optimization considering the overall functionality and security of the smart contract.
