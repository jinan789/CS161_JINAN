- code_repository/Comptroller_0xBafE01ff935C7305907c33BF824352eE5979B526/ComptrollerInterface.sol:   Summary of the entire contract: The Liquidity/Liquidation Calculation contract provides a single external view function to calculate the required collateral tokens to be seized and the remaining borrowed tokens after liquidation. This is useful for protocols implementing liquidation mechanisms to enable efficient and transparent calculation of liquidation amounts.

They allow reporting known errors from money markets and non-upgradeable collaborators, as well as opaque errors from upgradeable collaborator contracts. These contracts define enums for Error and FailureInfo and use internal functions (fail, failOpaque) to emit Failure events and return error codes as uints.

It provides functionalities such as setting and accepting new pending implementations, setting and accepting new pending admin addresses, and delegating execution to the implementation contract. The contract also emits events for implementation and admin changes.
