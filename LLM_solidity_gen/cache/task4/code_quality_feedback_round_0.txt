- Missing function visibility: The constructor should have the visibility specifier "public" or "internal" depending on the desired usage.
- Insufficient checks: repayBorrowAllowed function should also check for other requirements like sufficient collateral, user balances, etc., as mentioned in the comments.

Recommendations:
- Add visibility specifier for the constructor.
- Implement additional checks in the repayBorrowAllowed function to ensure the user has enough balance and collateral, and any other requirements specific to the use case.
