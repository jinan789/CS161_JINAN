<START_FUNCTIONS>
- name() external view returns (string memory): Returns the name of the token.
- symbol() external view returns (string memory): Returns the symbol of the token.
- decimals() external view returns (uint8): Returns the number of decimals the token uses.
- totalSupply() external view returns (uint256): Returns the total supply of tokens in circulation.
- balanceOf(address owner) external view returns (uint256 balance): Returns the balance of tokens held by the `owner` address.
- transfer(address dst, uint256 amount) external returns (bool success): Transfers `amount` of tokens from the caller (msg.sender) to the `dst` (destination) address. Returns true if the transfer is successful.
- transferFrom(address src, address dst, uint256 amount) external returns (bool success): Transfers `amount` of tokens from the `src` (source) address to the `dst` (destination) address. Returns true if the transfer is successful.
- approve(address spender, uint256 amount) external returns (bool success): Approves the `spender` address to transfer up to `amount` of tokens on behalf of the caller (msg.sender). Returns true if the approval is successful.
- allowance(address owner, address spender) external view returns (uint256 remaining): Returns the remaining number of tokens that the `spender` address is allowed to transfer from the `owner` address.

<START_CONTRACTS>
Summary of the entire contract:
The EIP20Interface contract is an interface for the ERC20 token standard, defining essential functions such as getting the token name, symbol, and decimals. It also includes functions to obtain the total supply, balance of a specific address, and allowance information. Transfer and approval-related functions (transfer, transferFrom, approve) control the movement of tokens between addresses and allow for token spending approvals. The contract also emits Transfer and Approval events to track token actions.
