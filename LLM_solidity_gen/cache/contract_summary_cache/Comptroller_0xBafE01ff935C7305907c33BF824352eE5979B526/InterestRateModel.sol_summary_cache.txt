<START_FUNCTIONS>
- bool public constant isInterestRateModel: Indicative variable that identifies the contract as an InterestRateModel.

- function getBorrowRate(uint cash, uint borrows, uint reserves) external view returns (uint):
  - Input: cash (total amount of cash in the market); borrows (total amount of outstanding borrows in the market); reserves (total amount of reserves in the market).
  - Output: The borrow rate per block, as a percentage scaled by 1e18.
  - Summary: Calculates the current borrow interest rate per block based on the market conditions (cash, borrows, and reserves).

- function getSupplyRate(uint cash, uint borrows, uint reserves, uint reserveFactorMantissa) external view returns (uint):
  - Input: cash (total amount of cash in the market); borrows (total amount of outstanding borrows in the market); reserves (total amount of reserves in the market); reserveFactorMantissa (current reserve factor in the market).
  - Output: The supply rate per block, as a percentage scaled by 1e18.
  - Summary: Calculates the current supply interest rate per block based on the market conditions (cash, borrows, reserves) and the reserve factor.

<START_CONTRACTS>
Summary of the entire contract:
The InterestRateModel contract is an interface for creating interest rate models on lending platforms such as Compound. It provides a standard for calculating borrow and supply interest rates per block based on the market conditions and reserve factors. Implementing the contract defines the contract as an InterestRateModel for inspection purposes.
