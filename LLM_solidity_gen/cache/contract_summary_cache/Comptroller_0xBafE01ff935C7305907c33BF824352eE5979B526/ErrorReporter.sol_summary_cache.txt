<START_CONTRACTS>
Summary of the entire contract:
The ComptrollerErrorReporter and TokenErrorReporter contracts provide error reporting functionality for other contracts in the system. They allow reporting known errors from money markets and non-upgradeable collaborators, as well as opaque errors from upgradeable collaborator contracts. These contracts define enums for Error and FailureInfo and use internal functions (fail, failOpaque) to emit Failure events and return error codes as uints.
