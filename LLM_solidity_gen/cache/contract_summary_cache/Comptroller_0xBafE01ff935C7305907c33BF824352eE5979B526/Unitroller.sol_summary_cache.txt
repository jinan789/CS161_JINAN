<START_CONTRACTS>
Summary of the entire contract:
The Unitroller contract serves as a storage contract for the Comptroller, enabling the execution of logic through a separate implementation contract. It provides functionalities such as setting and accepting new pending implementations, setting and accepting new pending admin addresses, and delegating execution to the implementation contract. The contract also emits events for implementation and admin changes.
