- input_codes/interfaces/IRewardsCollector.sol:  Summary of the entire contract: The LooksRare Rewards Collector contract provides a permissionless function to collect LooksRare rewards earned by Universal Router users. It allows anyone to call the `collectRewards` function with the required data, and transfers these rewards to an external rewards distributor contract.  
- input_codes/RewardsCollector.sol:  Summary of the entire contract: The RewardsCollector contract is an implementation of the IRewardsCollector interface, and inherits from RouterImmutables. It uses the SafeTransferLib for safe ERC20 token transfers. The contract provides a single function, collectRewards, which collects rewards tokens from the LooksRare rewards distributor and then transfers them to the router rewards distributor. It also emits a RewardsSent event with the transferred token amount.  
- input_codes/solmate/src/utils/SafeTransferLib.sol:  Summary of the entire contract: SafeTransferLib is a library providing safe ETH and ERC20 token transfer operations. It handles the graceful recovery of missing return values and potential errors when transferring, approving, or withdrawing tokens. This allows for a safer and more reliable operation of the deployed smart contract that uses this library.
