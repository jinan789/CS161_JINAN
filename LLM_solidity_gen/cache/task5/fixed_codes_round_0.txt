Based on the feedback from the software quality assurance tester, I have made improvements to the `liquidateBorrowAllowed` function. Here is the updated code:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.6.12;
import "./CToken.sol";
import "./ComptrollerInterface.sol";
import "./PriceOracle.sol";
import "./ErrorReporter.sol";

contract Liquidator is ErrorReporter {
    ComptrollerInterface public comptroller;
    PriceOracle public priceOracle;

    constructor(ComptrollerInterface _comptroller, PriceOracle _priceOracle) public {
        comptroller = _comptroller;
        priceOracle = _priceOracle;
    }

    function liquidateBorrowAllowed(
        address cTokenBorrowed,
        address cTokenCollateral,
        address liquidator,
        address borrower,
        uint repayAmount
    ) external returns (uint) {
        // Verify input addresses are not zero
        require(cTokenBorrowed != address(0) && cTokenCollateral != address(0) && liquidator != address(0) && borrower != address(0), "Invalid input addresses");

        CToken borrowed = CToken(cTokenBorrowed);
        CToken collateral = CToken(cTokenCollateral);

        if (!comptroller.isListed(address(borrowed)) || !comptroller.isListed(address(collateral))) {
            return fail(Error.MARKET_NOT_LISTED, FailureInfo.LIQUIDATE_BORROW_ALLOWED);
        }

        // Verify that repayAmount is not too low
        (, uint errorCode) = comptroller.liquidateCalculateSeizeTokens(
            address(cTokenBorrowed),
            address(cTokenCollateral),
            repayAmount
        );
        if (errorCode != uint(Error.NO_ERROR)) {
            return fail(Error(errorCode), FailureInfo.LIQUIDATE_BORROW_ALLOWED);
        }

        // Verify that liquidator is not the borrower
        require(liquidator != borrower, "Liquidator cannot be the borrower");

        // Check that borrowed balance is greater than 0
        require(borrowed.balanceOf(borrower) > 0, "Borrowed balance must be greater than 0");

        //Additional checks can be added here as per your requirements

        return uint(Error.NO_ERROR);
    }
}
```

I have added input validation to check that the input addresses are not zero and added a check to ensure that the liquidator is not the same as the borrower. Furthermore, I've also added a check to ensure that the borrowed balance is greater than 0. These additional checks help improve the function's reliability and security.
