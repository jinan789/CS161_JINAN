Your job is to find if a given chunk of Solidity codes contains any lines of codes that exhibit a specific pattern that is given below. The reason we want to find the specific pattern is that we want to fix the codes that waste gas during deployment or running. More information is given below:

First, let's clarify the concept of gas: gas refers to the unit that measures the amount of computational effort required to execute specific operations on the Ethereum network. Since each Ethereum transaction requires computational resources to execute, each transaction requires a fee. Gas refers to the fee required to execute a transaction on Ethereum, regardless of transaction success or failure.

Second, let's specify the type of patterns that we want to find. The specific type of pattern we want to identify here is called "Loop fusion." It is classified under the "Loop-related Patterns" category. More specifically, it refers to the pattern where there are several separate loops which could be combined into one, without changing the functionality. This has the benefit of reducing gas, in the sense that it can reduce the number of operations, such as conditional jumps and comparison, etc., at the entry points of loops. 

Third, let's give you the codes from which we want to find the specified patterns, and please tell me if it contains any such patterns. In addition, if it contains any such patterns, please also tell me the where the codes exhibiting such patterns are, as well as the statements that are guaranteed to not be executed. If there are multiple pieces of codes that contain the specified patterns, make sure to contain each occurrence in the output. The codes are:
