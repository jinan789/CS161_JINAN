Next, please be reminded of the following important points:
1. Interfaces do not have any implementations that could be directly called. Make sure not to instantiate any interfaces. Here is a list of interfaces in the available code base that was provided: (interface IRewardsCollector)
2. Consider using external functions and variables (such as addresses and pre-defined constants) when writing the codes
3. Be careful when making inheritance (e.g. contract B is A), and make sure the inheritance does have a significance or correlation

Next, if needed, you could use the following contextual information (external functions that are available to be called in the generated codes) that we just extracted as external calls in the generated codes. The format of the given functions will start with the <START_FUNCTIONS> token and end with the <END_FUNCTIONS> token, with each bullet point representing a function and starting at a new line. The contract that each function comes from is also provided at the end of each bullet point. The context information is as follows:
