The function that I want you to summarize is collectRewards(bytes calldata looksRareClaim, which is defined in the codes given below. Please note that I have hidden the definition of all other functions, but I still kept their signatureS, with the purpose of providing richer background information for you. The codes are:

import {SafeTransferLib} from 'solmate/src/utils/SafeTransferLib.sol';
import {RouterImmutables} from './RouterImmutables.sol';
import {IRewardsCollector} from '../interfaces/IRewardsCollector.sol';

abstract contract RewardsCollector is IRewardsCollector, RouterImmutables {
    using SafeTransferLib for ERC20;

    event RewardsSent(uint256 amount);

    error UnableToClaim();
