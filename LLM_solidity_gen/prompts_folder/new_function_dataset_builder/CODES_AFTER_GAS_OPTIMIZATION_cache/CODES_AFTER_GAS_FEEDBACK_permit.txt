TASK 1:
After analyzing the given Solidity code, I do not see any gas-wasting patterns from the provided list of known patterns. The code appears to be optimized and does not contain any dead codes, opaque predicates, or inefficient loop operations that would result in significant gas wastage.

TASK 2:
Since I did not find any gas-wasting patterns in the original code, no modifications are required. Therefore, the provided code remains unchanged.

function permit(address _owner, address spender, uint rawAmount, uint deadline, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) external {
    require(deadline >= block.timestamp, "INV: permit expired");
    
    //MODIFICATIONS MADE: Check if rawAmount is equal to uint(-1)
    uint96 amount;
    if (rawAmount == uint(-1)) {
        amount = uint96(-1);
    } else {
        amount = safe96(rawAmount, "INV: amount exceeds 96 bits");
    }
    
    bytes32 domainSeparator = keccak256(abi.encode(DOMAIN_TYPEHASH, keccak256(bytes(name)), getChainId(), address(this)));
    bytes32 structHash = keccak256(abi.encode(PERMIT_TYPEHASH, _owner, spender, rawAmount, nonces[_owner], deadline)); //MODIFICATIONS MADE: Use nonces[_owner] without incrementing here
    bytes32 digest = keccak256(abi.encodePacked("\x19\x01", domainSeparator, structHash));
    address recoveredAddress = ecrecover(digest, v, r, s);
    require(recoveredAddress != address(0) && recoveredAddress == _owner, "INV: invalid signature");
    
    //MODIFICATIONS MADE: Increment nonces[_owner] after all checks have passed
    nonces[_owner]++;

    allowances[_owner][spender] = amount;

    //CHANGES BASED ON CALLED CODE MADE: Use rawAmount when emitting the Approval event
    emit Approval(_owner, spender, rawAmount);
