After analyzing the given Solidity code, I have found that it does not contain any gas-wasting pattern from the list provided. The function implementation is straightforward, without loops or conditional branching that would lead to any of the gas inefficiencies mentioned.

Given that there are no matching patterns found in the code, there are no fixes or updates needed for the provided function. Therefore, no changes are necessary, and the original code remains unchanged.

Here is the code provided, with the requested tokens added at the beginning and end:

<CODE_BEGINNING>
function _acceptAdmin() public returns (uint) {
    // Check if the caller is the pending admin and that the pending admin is not the zero address
    if (msg.sender != pendingAdmin || msg.sender == address(0)) {
        return fail(Error.UNAUTHORIZED, FailureInfo.ACCEPT_ADMIN_PENDING_ADMIN_CHECK);
    }

    // Update the admin to the value of the pending admin
    address oldAdmin = admin;
    admin = pendingAdmin;

    // Clear the pending admin value
    address oldPendingAdmin = pendingAdmin;
    pendingAdmin = address(0);

    // Emit events for the updated admin and pending admin
    emit NewAdmin(oldAdmin, admin);
    emit NewPendingAdmin(oldPendingAdmin, pendingAdmin);

    return uint(Error.NO_ERROR);
}
<CODE_ENDING>

Since there are no identified optimizations and thus no modifications made, no comments are added to indicate changes.
