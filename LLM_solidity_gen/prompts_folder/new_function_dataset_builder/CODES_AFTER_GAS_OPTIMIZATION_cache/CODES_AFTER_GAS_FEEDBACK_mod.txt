TASK 1: I have analyzed the given Solidity codes and couldn't find any gas-wasting patterns when comparing the code to the provided list of known gas-wasting patterns. The code appears to be efficient and well-structured.

TASK 2: Since there are no gas-wasting patterns found in the original code, there is no need to make any corrections or updates. As a result, the original code remains as it is:

<CODE_BEGINNING>
function mod(uint256 a, uint256 b, string memory errorMessage) internal pure returns (uint256) {
    //CHANGES BASED ON CALLED CODE MADE: Added require statement to handle division by zero
    require(b != 0, errorMessage);
    return a % b;
}
<CODE_ENDING>
