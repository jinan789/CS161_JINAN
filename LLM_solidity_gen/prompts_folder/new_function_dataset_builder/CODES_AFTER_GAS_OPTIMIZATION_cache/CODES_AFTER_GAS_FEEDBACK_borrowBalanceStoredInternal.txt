TASK 1: Based on the given patterns and codes, the written codes do not seem to match any of the gas-wasting patterns provided. The code does not have any dead code, opaque predicate, expensive operations in a loop, constant outcome of a loop, loop fusion, repeated computations in a loop, or comparison with unilateral outcome in a loop.

TASK 2: Since there were no matches in the gas-wasting patterns, the code remains the same without any modifications or comments:

<CODE_BEGINNING>
//CHANGES BASED ON CALLED CODE MADE: Assumed that `accountBorrows` is defined as a mapping(address => BorrowSnapshot) and `borrowIndex` is defined
function borrowBalanceStoredInternal(address account) internal view returns (MathError errorCode, uint borrowBalance) {
    // Step 1: Get the account's borrow snapshot
    BorrowSnapshot storage borrowSnapshot = accountBorrows[account];

    // Step 2: If the account's borrow balance is 0, return 0
    if (borrowSnapshot.principal == 0) {
        return (MathError.NO_ERROR, 0);
    }

    // Step 3: Calculate the account's borrow balance based on the current borrow index
    uint currentBorrowIndex = borrowIndex;

    // Step 4: Multiply the borrower's borrow snapshot principal with the current borrow index
    uint principalTimesIndex;
    (errorCode, principalTimesIndex) = mulUInt(borrowSnapshot.principal, currentBorrowIndex);

    // Step 5: Check for math errors during multiplication
    if (errorCode != MathError.NO_ERROR) {
        return (errorCode, 0);
    }

    // Step 6: Divide the result by the borrow snapshot index to get the borrow balance
    uint result;
    (errorCode, result) = divUInt(principalTimesIndex, borrowSnapshot.index);

    // Step 7: Check for math errors during division
    if (errorCode != MathError.NO_ERROR) {
        return (errorCode, 0);
    }

    // Step 8: Return the borrow balance with a NO_ERROR code
    return (MathError.NO_ERROR, result);
}
