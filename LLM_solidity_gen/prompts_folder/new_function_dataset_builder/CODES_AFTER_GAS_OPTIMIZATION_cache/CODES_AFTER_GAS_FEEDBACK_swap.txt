TASK 1:

Upon reviewing the provided code, I found there are no gas-wasting patterns that match the given list. The code seems to be optimized well for gas usage. However, there is one small improvement that can be done even though it does not directly correspond to the given list of patterns. The change is related to moving the safeTransferFrom function below the require statements for small efficiency gain:

Improvement:

- Move the safeTransferFrom function below require statements: This allows any transaction that does not meet the requirements to fail early resulting in a smaller amount of gas being consumed.
