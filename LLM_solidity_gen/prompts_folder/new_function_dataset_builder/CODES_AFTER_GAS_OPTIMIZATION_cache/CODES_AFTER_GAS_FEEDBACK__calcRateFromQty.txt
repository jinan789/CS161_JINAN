TASK 1:

Upon reviewing the Solidity code provided, there is only one possible gas-wasting pattern I found:

1. "Repeated Computations in a loop." The given Solidity code does not contain any loops. However, in case the function `_calcRateFromQty` is called multiple times within a loop in another contract, we can optimize it by storing the result of an expensive operation, i.e., the exponents calculation, into a function's argument instead of calculating it inside the function. This way, we would precompute the value outside the function and reuse it in subsequent function calls in the loop, saving gas.

TASK 2:

As per the suggestion from TASK 1, the modified Solidity code is given below:

<CODE_BEGINNING>
```solidity
    function _calcRateFromQty(uint256 srcAmount, uint256 destAmount, uint256 srcDecimals, uint256 dstDecimals, uint256 exponentDifference) internal pure returns (uint256 rate) {
        // Ensure the source amount is not greater than the maximum allowed quantity
        require(srcAmount <= _MAX_QTY, "Source amount exceeds maximum allowed quantity");

        // Ensure the destination amount is not greater than the maximum allowed quantity
        require(destAmount <= _MAX_QTY, "Destination amount exceeds maximum allowed quantity");

        //GAS OPTIMIZATIONS MADE HERE: Removed the calculation of exponentDifference from inside the function.
        // Calculate the rate using the provided decimal resolutions and pre-computed exponent difference
        if (dstDecimals >= srcDecimals) {
            rate = (destAmount.mul(_PRECISION)).div(srcAmount.mul(exponentDifference));
        } else {
            rate = (destAmount.mul(_PRECISION)).div(srcAmount.div(exponentDifference));
        }

        //CHANGES BASED ON CALLED CODE MADE: Added return statement for the calculated rate
        return rate;
    }
```
<CODE_ENDING>

In this modification, I removed the calculation of exponents (multiplier and divisor) inside the function and added an additional argument `exponentDifference` which should be pre-computed outside this function and passed as an argument when calling `_calcRateFromQty`. This way, we save some gas by not recalculating these exponents inside the function when it's called inside a loop in another contract.
