Based on the given patterns and codes, I did not find any gas-wasting patterns in the provided Solidity codes. The implementation seems to have a good standard and should not waste gas. Therefore, neither TASK 1 nor TASK 2 are applicable in this case, as there are no patterns to identify or changes to make in the code provided.

<CODE_BEGINNING>
    function _upgradeBeaconToAndCall(
        address newBeacon,
        bytes memory data,
        bool forceCall
    ) internal {
        _setBeacon(newBeacon);
        emit BeaconUpgraded(newBeacon);
        if (data.length > 0 || forceCall) {
            _functionDelegateCall(IBeaconUpgradeable(newBeacon).implementation(), data);
        }
    }
