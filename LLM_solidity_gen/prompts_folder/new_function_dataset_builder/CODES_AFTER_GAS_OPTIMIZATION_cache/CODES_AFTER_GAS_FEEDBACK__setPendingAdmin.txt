TASK 1:
After analyzing your code, I didn't find any gas-wasting patterns that match the list provided. Your code is efficient, and it doesn't contain any dead codes, opaque predicates, expensive operations in a loop, constant outcomes of a loop, loop fusion, repeated computations in a loop, or comparisons with unilateral outcomes in a loop. Therefore, no modifications are suggested based on the gas-wasting patterns list.

TASK 2:
Since no gas-wasting patterns were found in your code, I'll provide the same code with <CODE_BEGINNING> and <CODE_ENDING> tokens added. No additional comments required as no changes were made.

<CODE_BEGINNING>
function _setPendingAdmin(address payable newPendingAdmin) external nonReentrant returns (uint) {
    //MODIFICATIONS MADE: Added nonReentrant modifier for consistency and security against reentrancy attacks

    // Check caller is admin
    //MODIFICATIONS MADE: Replaced require with if condition and fail function for error handling consistency with example functions
    if (msg.sender != admin) {
        return fail(Error.UNAUTHORIZED, FailureInfo.SET_PENDING_ADMIN_OWNER_CHECK);
    }

    //CHANGES BASED ON CALLED CODE MADE: Added require statement to check that the newPendingAdmin address is non-zero
    require(newPendingAdmin != address(0), "New pending admin address must be non-zero");
    
    address oldPendingAdmin = pendingAdmin;
    pendingAdmin = newPendingAdmin;

    emit NewPendingAdmin(oldPendingAdmin, newPendingAdmin);

    return uint(Error.NO_ERROR);
}
<CODE_ENDING>
