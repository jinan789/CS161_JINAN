TASK 1:
After analyzing the provided code snippet, no gas-wasting patterns are found. The function is well-optimized, and there are no obvious optimizations that could be performed.

TASK 2:
As there are no changes to be made, the provided code remains the same:

<CODE_BEGINNING>
function mulUInt(uint a, uint b) internal pure returns (MathError errorCode, uint result) {
    // Check for overflow condition
    if (a == 0) {
        // If a is zero, the result is always zero, no overflow possible
        return (MathError.NO_ERROR, 0);
    }

    // Calculate the multiplication result
    uint256 c = a * b;

    // Check if the division result is equal to the original value of a, if not, it's an overflow
    if (c / a != b) {
        return (MathError.INTEGER_OVERFLOW, 0);
    }

    // If operation was successful, return no error and the multiplication result
    return (MathError.NO_ERROR, c);
}
