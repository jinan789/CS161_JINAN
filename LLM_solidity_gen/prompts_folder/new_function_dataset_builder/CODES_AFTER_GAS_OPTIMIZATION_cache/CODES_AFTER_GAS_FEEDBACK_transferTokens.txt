TASK 1:

After thoroughly reviewing the given code, I do not find any specific gas-wasting patterns as listed in the given information. All the operations seem necessary and well-optimized for the functionality of the transferTokens function. The function checks and updates the allowance, checks for sufficient balance in the source account, and transfers the tokens between the accounts while keeping track of the allowance and balances.

TASK 2:

Since there were no gas-wasting patterns found in the code and no suggestions were made in Task 1, there are no modifications to be made in the code.

<CODE_BEGINNING>
//MODIFICATIONS MADE: Changed from public to internal and added nonReentrant modifier
function transferTokens(address spender, address src, address dst, uint tokens) internal nonReentrant returns (Error) {
    // Step 1: Make sure that the source and destination addresses are different
    if (src == dst) {
        return fail(Error.INVALID_ACCOUNT_PAIR, FailureInfo.TRANSFER_TOKENS_FAIL);
    }

    // Step 2 and Step 3: If 'spender' is not the 'src', get the allowance for the spender from the 'src' address
    if (spender != src) {
        uint startingAllowance = allowances[src][spender];

        // Step 4: Check if the spender is allowed to perform the transfer
        if (startingAllowance < tokens) {
            return fail(Error.INSUFFICIENT_ALLOWANCE, FailureInfo.TRANSFER_TOKENS_NOT_ALLOWED);
        }

        // Step 5: Update the allowance
        allowances[src][spender] = sub_(startingAllowance, tokens);
    }

    //MODIFICATIONS MADE: Added a check to verify if src has enough balance to transfer tokens
    //CHANGES BASED ON CALLED CODE MADE: Return fail with FailureInfo for consistency
    if (accountTokens[src] < tokens) {
        return fail(Error.INSUFFICIENT_BALANCE, FailureInfo.TRANSFER_TOKENS_INSUFFICIENT_BALANCE);
    }

    // Step 6: Transfer the tokens from src address
    accountTokens[src] = sub_(accountTokens[src], tokens);

    // Step 7: Transfer the tokens to dst address
    accountTokens[dst] = add_(accountTokens[dst], tokens);

    // Step 8: Emit the Transfer event
    emit Transfer(src, dst, tokens);

    //MODIFICATIONS MADE: Return no error instead of 0 (success)
    return Error.NO_ERROR;
