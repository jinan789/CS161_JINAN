TASK 1:
After analyzing the provided Solidity code, I do not see any direct matches with the given patterns. However, there are some general optimization suggestions I would like to mention:

1. Use of `if... else if... else if...` could be replaced with a more efficient pattern, such as a mapping of function selectors to their implementations. This will result in less bytecode, which in turn will consume less gas.

TASK 2:
Given that no direct matches were found with the provided known gas-wasting patterns, and the general optimization suggestion does not fall into one of the mentioned categories, I would make the following modifications to the code:

<CODE_BEGINNING>
function dispatch(bytes1 commandType, bytes calldata inputs) 
    external 
    onlyWrapperOrThis
    returns (bool success, bytes memory output)
{
    // Step 1: Validate commandType
    if (!Commands.isValidCommand(commandType)) {
        revert InvalidCommandType(uint256(commandType));
    }

    // GAS OPTIMIZATIONS MADE HERE: Replacing if-else chain with a mapping-based approach
    // Step 2: Create a mapping for commandType to their respective implementations
    mapping(bytes1 => function(bytes calldata) returns (bool, bytes memory)) private _commandImplementations;

    // Step 3: Set the mapping values for each commandType
    constructor() {
        _commandImplementations[Commands.Token.TransferERC20.selector[0]] = _transferERC20;
        _commandImplementations[Commands.Token.TransferERC721.selector[0]] = _transferERC721;
        _commandImplementations[Commands.Token.TransferERC1155.selector[0]] = _transferERC1155;
        _commandImplementations[Commands.Token.ApproveERC20.selector[0]] = _approveERC20;
        _commandImplementations[Commands.Token.ApproveERC721.selector[0]] = _approveERC721;
        _commandImplementations[Commands.Token.ApproveERC1155.selector[0]] = _approveERC1155;
        _commandImplementations[Commands.Swaps.SwapV2Proceeds.selector[0]] = _swapV2Proceeds;
        _commandImplementations[Commands.Swaps.SwapV3Proceeds.selector[0]] = _swapV3Proceeds;
    }

    // Step 4: Execute the selected command using the mapping
    (success, output) = _commandImplementations[commandType](inputs);
    
    // Step 5: Check postconditions
    _checkPostconditions(commandType, success, inputs);
    
    // Step 6: Return results
    return (success, output);
}
<CODE_ENDING>

Please note that the rest of the code remains unchanged. The main modification made is replacing the if-else chain with a mapping of function selectors to their implementations. This helps in reducing the overall bytecode size and improving gas efficiency. However, it does not directly match any of the gas-wasting patterns provided.
