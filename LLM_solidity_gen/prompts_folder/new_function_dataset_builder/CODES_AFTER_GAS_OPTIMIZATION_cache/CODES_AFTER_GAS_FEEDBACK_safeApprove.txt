After evaluating the given Solidity codes, I found that your codes do not match any of the given gas-wasting patterns. The provided function seems to be properly optimized, and I cannot find any inefficiencies that would result in wasted gas.

As a result, for TASK 1, there are no bullet points that indicate any inefficient patterns found within the codes.

For TASK 2, since there are no inefficiencies found and no modifications needed, the updated code would remain the same as the original code:

<CODE_BEGINNING>
function safeApprove(
    ERC20 token,
    address to,
    uint256 amount
) internal {
    bool success;

    // CHANGES BASED ON CALLED CODE MADE: Updating the function selector for the approve function.
    bytes4 approveSelector = bytes4(keccak256("approve(address,uint256)"));

    assembly {
        // Get a pointer to some free memory.
        let freeMemoryPointer := mload(0x40)

        // Write the ABI-encoded calldata into memory, beginning with the function selector.
        mstore(freeMemoryPointer, shl(224, approveSelector)) // Update the function selector.
        mstore(add(freeMemoryPointer, 4), to) // Append the "to" argument.
        mstore(add(freeMemoryPointer, 36), amount) // Append the "amount" argument.

        success := and(
            // Set success to whether the call reverted; if not, we check it either
            // returned exactly 1 (can't just be non-zero data), or had no return data.
            or(and(eq(mload(0), 1), gt(returndatasize(), 31)), iszero(returndatasize())),
            // We use 68 because the length of our calldata totals up like so: 4 + 32 * 2.
            // We use 0 and 32 to copy up to 32 bytes of return data into the scratch space.
            // Counterintuitively, this call must be positioned second to the or() call in the
            // surrounding and() call, or else returndatasize() will be zero during the computation.
            call(gas(), token, 0, freeMemoryPointer, 68, 0, 32)
        )
    }

    // Retaining the require statement as it is consistent with the need to revert in case of failure.
    require(success, "APPROVE_FAILED");
}
