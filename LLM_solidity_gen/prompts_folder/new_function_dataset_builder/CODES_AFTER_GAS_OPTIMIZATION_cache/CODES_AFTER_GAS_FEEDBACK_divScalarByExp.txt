After analyzing your code, it seems that it doesn't match any of the gas-wasting patterns listed above. The code appears to be efficient and optimized. Therefore, no modifications are needed for this code. Here is the unchanged code with the requested tokens added:

<CODE_BEGINNING>
function divScalarByExp(uint scalar, Exp memory divisor) pure internal returns (MathError, Exp memory) {
    //CHANGES BASED ON CALLED CODE MADE: Replaced divUInt() to divScalar() since scalar needs to be divided by an Exp memory type
    (MathError mathError, Exp memory expResult) = divScalar(Exp({mantissa: scalar}), divisor.mantissa);
    if (mathError != MathError.NO_ERROR) {
        return (mathError, Exp({mantissa: 0}));
    }
    
    return (MathError.NO_ERROR, expResult);
}
