TASK 1:
Upon analyzing your Solidity code, no obvious gas-wasting patterns are found that match the list of patterns provided. The code appears to be well structured and optimized without any dead codes, opaque predicates, unnecessary loops, or repeated computations.

TASK 2:
Since no gas-wasting patterns were found in your Solidity code, no modifications are needed. Your original code remains the same:

<CODE_BEGINNING>
function safeDecreaseAllowance(
    IERC20 token,
    address spender,
    uint256 value
) internal {
    uint256 currentAllowance = token.allowance(address(this), spender);
    require(currentAllowance >= value, "SafeERC20: decreased allowance below zero");
    uint256 newAllowance = currentAllowance - value;
    _callOptionalReturn(token, abi.encodeWithSelector(token.approve.selector, spender, newAllowance));
}
