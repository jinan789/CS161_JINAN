TASK 1: Based on the given patterns and codes, I found the following gas-wasting pattern in your code:

1. Opaque predicate:
   - In the condition "if (msg.sender == admin)", since admin was just assigned the value of msg.sender, the condition is always true, making the predicate check unnecessary.
   
   Suggestion for fix: Remove the condition check and directly use a "require" statement for checking the validity of the newComptroller address.

TASK 2: Based on the suggestions from TASK 1, here are the necessary corrections/updates to the code:

<CODE_BEGINNING>
function _setComptroller(ComptrollerInterface newComptroller) external returns (uint, uint) {
    // CHANGES BASED ON CALLED CODE MADE: Change the global variable name for the admin
    address admin = msg.sender;

    // GAS OPTIMIZATIONS MADE HERE: Removed the unnecessary condition check for "msg.sender == admin", since it is always true 
    // CHANGES BASED ON CALLED CODE MADE: Replace the "if" statement with "require" statements for better error handling
    require(address(newComptroller) != address(0), "INVALID_COMPTROLLER_ADDRESS");

    // Ensure the new comptroller passes the "isComptroller" validation
    if (!newComptroller.isComptroller()) {
        return (uint(Error.CONTROLLER_CHECK), uint(FailureInfo.SET_COMPTROLLER_VALIDATION));
    }

    // Set new comptroller and emit event
    ComptrollerInterface oldComptroller = comptroller;
    comptroller = newComptroller;
    emit NewComptroller(oldComptroller, newComptroller);

    // Return success code
    return (uint(Error.NO_ERROR), 0);
}
