After analyzing the provided codes, I found that your codes do not match any of the given gas-wasting patterns. The function seems to be simple and straightforward. Therefore, no suggestions for optimizations are required in this case.

Accordingly, the tasks are:
TASK 1: 
None of the given gas-wasting patterns are found in the provided codes.

TASK 2:
As no gas-wasting patterns were found in the provided codes, no modifications are required. Here is your original function:

<CODE_BEGINNING>
function _upgradeToAndCallSecure(
    address newImplementation,
    bytes memory data,
    bool forceCall
) internal {
    // Step 1: Store the current implementation before upgrading
    address currentImplementation = _getImplementation();

    // CHANGES BASED ON CALLED CODE MADE: Replaced _upgradeTo with _upgradeToAndCall to handle delegate call properly
    // Step 2: Upgrade to the new implementation and perform delegate call
    _upgradeToAndCall(newImplementation, data, forceCall);

    //CHANGES BASED ON CALLED CODE MADE: Removed unnecessary if condition for performing delegate call
}
