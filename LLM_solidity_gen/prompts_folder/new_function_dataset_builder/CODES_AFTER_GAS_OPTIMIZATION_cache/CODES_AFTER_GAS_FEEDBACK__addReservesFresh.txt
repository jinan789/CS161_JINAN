TASK 1: Based on the given patterns and codes, the provided Solidity code does not seem to contain any obvious gas-wasting patterns from the provided list. However, there are some modifications and comments added in the code that can be improved upon:

1. "MODIFICATIONS MADE" comments: These comments are not necessarily relevant to gas optimizations and can be removed or updated to make the comments more readable and relevant to the context of the code.
2. Updating ContractName.Error usage: Adding the contract name before the Error enumeration is a change made based on the called code, but it doesn't have an impact on gas optimization. However, it is a good practice to keep the code updated and functionally correct.

TASK 2: As there are no gas-wasting patterns found in the code, only comments and ContractName.Error will be updated. Here is the updated code:

<CODE_BEGINNING>
function _addReservesFresh(uint addAmount) internal nonReentrant returns (uint, uint) {
    // Check for fresh block number
    if (accrualBlockNumber != getBlockNumber()) {
        return (uint(ContractName.Error.NOT_FRESH), 0);
    }

    // Transfer tokens from msg.sender to the contract
    uint actualAddAmount = doTransferIn(msg.sender, addAmount); // Ensure the implementation of doTransferIn is gas-efficient

    // Increase total reserves by the actual transferred amount
    totalReserves = add_(totalReserves, actualAddAmount);

    // Emit the ReservesAdded event
    emit ReservesAdded(msg.sender, addAmount, actualAddAmount);

    return (uint(ContractName.Error.NO_ERROR), actualAddAmount);
}
