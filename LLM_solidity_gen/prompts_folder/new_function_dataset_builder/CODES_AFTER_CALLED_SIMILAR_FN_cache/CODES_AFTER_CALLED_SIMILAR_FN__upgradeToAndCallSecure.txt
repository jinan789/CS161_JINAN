TASK 1: Issue Finding

1. Misused function:
- You are using _upgradeTo function instead of _upgradeToAndCall function on line 9 in your code.
- Fix: Change _upgradeTo(newImplementation) to _upgradeToAndCall(newImplementation, data, forceCall) to handle upgrade and delegate call properly, as given in the provided functions list.

2. Unnecessary if condition:
- Lines 12-13 have an if condition that checks data.length > 0 or forceCall, which is already handled in _upgradeToAndCall function.
- Fix: Remove this if condition as it is redundant.

TASK 2: Code Modification

<CODE_BEGINNING>
function _upgradeToAndCallSecure(
    address newImplementation,
    bytes memory data,
    bool forceCall
) internal {
    // Step 1: Store the current implementation before upgrading
    address currentImplementation = _getImplementation();

    // CHANGES BASED ON CALLED CODE MADE: Replaced _upgradeTo with _upgradeToAndCall to handle delegate call properly
    // Step 2: Upgrade to the new implementation and perform delegate call
    _upgradeToAndCall(newImplementation, data, forceCall);

    //CHANGES BASED ON CALLED CODE MADE: Removed unnecessary if condition for performing delegate call
}
