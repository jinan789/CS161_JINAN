TASK 1:

1. Incorrect decoding of the inputs parameter: The method used in the given code to decode 'inputs' is not proper. It would not decode the correct values for various fields in 'inputs'.

Suggestion: Use abi.decode() function for proper decoding of the inputs.

2. map function does not seem to be a proper function or implementation for mapping the recipient address.

Suggestion: Get rid of the map function and directly use the recipient value in transferFrom()

TASK 2:

<CODE_BEGINNING>

//CHANGES BASED ON CALLED CODE MADE: Fixed the input decoding
function callAndTransfer721(bytes calldata inputs, address protocol) internal returns (bool success, bytes memory output) {
    (uint256 value, bytes calldata data, address recipient, address token) = abi.decode(inputs, (uint256, bytes, address, address));

    // Perform a call to the specified protocol with the given value and data
    (success, output) = protocol.call{value: value}(data);

    // If the call is successful, transfer the ERC721 token to the recipient
    if (success) {
        //CHANGES BASED ON CALLED CODE MADE: Removed the map function usage
        ERC721 erc721Token = ERC721(token);
        erc721Token.transferFrom(address(this), recipient, value);
    }

    return (success, output);
