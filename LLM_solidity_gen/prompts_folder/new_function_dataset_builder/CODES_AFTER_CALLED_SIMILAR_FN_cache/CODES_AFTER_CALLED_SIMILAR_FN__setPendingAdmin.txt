I have reviewed your provided code and information, and found some issues that need to be addressed as follows:

TASK 1: Found Issues and Suggestions
1. Your "_setPendingAdmin" function does not have any misuse of functions or variables, based on the provided information. However, some minor improvements can be made (mentioned in suggestions).

Suggestions:
a) Although not a misuse, adding a require statement to check that the newPendingAdmin address is non-zero would be a good practice to prevent accidentally setting a zero address as the pending admin.

TASK 2: Corrections/Updates
<CODE_BEGINNING>
function _setPendingAdmin(address payable newPendingAdmin) external nonReentrant returns (uint) {
    //MODIFICATIONS MADE: Added nonReentrant modifier for consistency and security against reentrancy attacks

    // Check caller is admin
    //MODIFICATIONS MADE: Replaced require with if condition and fail function for error handling consistency with example functions
    if (msg.sender != admin) {
        return fail(Error.UNAUTHORIZED, FailureInfo.SET_PENDING_ADMIN_OWNER_CHECK);
    }

    //CHANGES BASED ON CALLED CODE MADE: Added require statement to check that the newPendingAdmin address is non-zero
    require(newPendingAdmin != address(0), "New pending admin address must be non-zero");
    
    address oldPendingAdmin = pendingAdmin;
    pendingAdmin = newPendingAdmin;

    emit NewPendingAdmin(oldPendingAdmin, newPendingAdmin);

    return uint(Error.NO_ERROR);
}
