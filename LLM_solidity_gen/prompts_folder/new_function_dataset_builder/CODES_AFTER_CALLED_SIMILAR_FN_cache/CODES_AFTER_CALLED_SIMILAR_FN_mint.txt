TASK 1:

1. Misuse of SafeMath.add function: In the code, SafeMath.add is used to update totalSupply, which might not be in sync with the contract's implementation since SafeMath is not used anywhere else.
Suggestion: Replace SafeMath.add with add96 while updating the total supply.

2. Inconsistency in using "INV" as the error message prefix: The other functions in the contract use "INV::" instead of "INV:" as the error message prefix.
Suggestion: Change the error message prefix to "INV::" for consistency.

TASK 2:
<CODE_BEGINNING>
function mint(address dst, uint rawAmount) external onlyOwner {
    require(dst != address(0), "INV:: cannot mint tokens to the zero address");

    // Update total supply of tokens
    //CHANGES BASED ON CALLED CODE MADE: Replaced SafeMath.add with add96 for consistency
    totalSupply = add96(totalSupply, safe96(rawAmount, "INV:: transfer amount overflows"), "INV:: total supply overflows");

    // Transfer the newly minted tokens to the specified address
    uint96 mintAmount = safe96(rawAmount, "INV:: transfer amount overflows"); //MODIFICATIONS MADE: Introduced new variable mintAmount since it is used multiple times in the function
    balances[dst] = add96(balances[dst], mintAmount, "INV:: transfer amount overflows");

    // Update the delegates of the recipient address
    _moveDelegates(address(0), delegates[dst], mintAmount); //MODIFICATIONS MADE: Replaced rawAmount with mintAmount (Already cast to uint96) to avoid repetitive casting

    // Emit the transfer event
    emit Transfer(address(0), dst, rawAmount);
