TASK 1:
1. Issue: The function getCult.getPriorVotes is not provided in the given information, so it's unclear if it's implemented correctly.
   Suggestion: If the function is implemented elsewhere and working correctly, no changes are needed. Otherwise, please provide the implementation to verify its correctness.

2. Issue: The function proposalThreshold is not provided in the given information, so it's unclear if it's implemented correctly, also it seems to be a variable, not a function.
   Suggestion: If the variable or function is implemented elsewhere and working correctly, no changes are needed. Otherwise, please provide the implementation or correct variable to verify its correctness.

3. Issue: The function proposalMaxOperations is not provided in the given information, so it's unclear if it's implemented correctly, also it seems to be a variable, not a function.
   Suggestion: If the variable or function is implemented elsewhere and working correctly, no changes are needed. Otherwise, please provide the implementation or correct variable to verify its correctness.

4. Issue: The function votingDelay is not provided in the given information, so it's unclear if it's implemented correctly, also it seems to be a variable, not a function.
   Suggestion: If the variable or function is implemented elsewhere and working correctly, no changes are needed. Otherwise, please provide the implementation or correct variable to verify its correctness.

5. Issue: The function votingPeriod is not provided in the given information, so it's unclear if it's implemented correctly, also it seems to be a variable, not a function. 
   Suggestion: If the variable or function is implemented elsewhere and working correctly, no changes are needed. Otherwise, please provide the implementation or correct variable to verify its correctness.

Overall, your code seems to be well-written and does not misuse the provided functions nor variables. The main issues are the missing functions/variables that are not provided in the given information. It is important to verify their correctness and proper implementation.

TASK 2:

Since there were no misuses of the provided functions or variables, no changes are needed in the given code. As mentioned in TASK 1, the main issue is the missing functions/variables that need to be verified and provided.
