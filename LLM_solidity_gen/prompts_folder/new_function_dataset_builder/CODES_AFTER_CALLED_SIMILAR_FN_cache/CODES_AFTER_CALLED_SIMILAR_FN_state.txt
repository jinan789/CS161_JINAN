TASK 1:
1. Issue: timelock.getPending(bytes32(proposalId)) and timelock.getTimestamp(bytes32(proposalId)) functions are not provided in Information 3. It is unclear if these functions exist in the contract.
   Suggestion: If these functions do not exist, implement them in the contract, or find suitable alternatives.

2. Issue: In the condition to return ProposalState.Expired, block.number is used instead of block.timestamp.
   Suggestion: Use block.timestamp instead of block.number to properly account for the elapsed time since the end of the proposal.
