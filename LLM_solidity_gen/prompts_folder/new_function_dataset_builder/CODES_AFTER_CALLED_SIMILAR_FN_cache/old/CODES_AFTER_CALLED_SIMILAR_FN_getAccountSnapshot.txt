TASK 1:

1. Function misuse:
In your `getAccountSnapshot` function, you called `borrowBalanceStoredInternal(account)` to get the borrow balance of the account, following by an error handling to check if there is a MathError. However, there is a public function `borrowBalanceStored(account)` that has already handled the requiring of no MathError. Using this function could make the code cleaner and more consistent.

2. Inconsistent error code:
In `getAccountSnapshot` function, you are returning `(uint(Error.MATH_ERROR), 0, 0, 0)` in case of MathError. However, in the given functions like `borrowBalanceStored` and `_addReservesInternal`, they use `fail()` function to emit an event in case of an error. It would be more consistent if you use the same approach to emit an event in case of an error in your function.

TASK 2:

<CODE_BEGINNING>
// MODIFICATIONS MADE: Made the function `view` instead of `public view` for consistency with few-shot examples
function getAccountSnapshot(address account) view returns (uint, uint, uint, uint) {
    uint cTokenBal = balanceOf(account);

    // CHANGES BASED ON CALLED CODE MADE: Using borrowBalanceStored instead of borrowBalanceStoredInternal
    uint borrowBal = borrowBalanceStored(account);

    (MathError exchangeRateMathErr, uint exchangeRateMantissa) = exchangeRateStoredInternal();
    if (exchangeRateMathErr != MathError.NO_ERROR) {
        // CHANGES BASED ON CALLED CODE MADE: Emitting an event instead of returning Error.MATH_ERROR
        return (fail(Error.MATH_ERROR, FailureInfo.EXCHANGE_RATE_MATH_ERROR), 0, 0, 0);
    }
    
    return (uint(Error.NO_ERROR), cTokenBal, borrowBal, exchangeRateMantissa);
}
