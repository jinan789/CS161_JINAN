TASK 1: Here are my findings and suggestions as an expert Solidity coder (note that there are no real misuses, but some small improvements can be made):

1. The "add256" function is being used to sum up the votes. Using "add256" is not incorrect, but since you are already using the SafeMath library, you can simply use the "+" operator provided by SafeMath instead. It makes the code more readable and follows common practices when the SafeMath library is used.

TASK 2: Based on my findings, here's the updated function with improvements:

<CODE_BEGINNING>
// MODIFICATIONS MADE: Changed the function visibility to internal
function castVoteInternal(address voter, uint proposalId, uint8 support) internal returns (uint256) {
    require(state(proposalId) == ProposalState.Active, "GovernorBravo::_castVoteInternal: voting is closed");
    require(support <= 2, "GovernorBravo::_castVoteInternal: invalid voting option");
    // MODIFICATIONS MADE: Replaced msg.sender with voter
    require(!isWhitelisted(voter),"GovernorBravo::_castVoteInternal: Top stakers cannot cast vote");

    Proposal storage proposal = proposals[proposalId];
    Receipt storage receipt = proposal.receipts[voter];
    require(receipt.hasVoted == false, "GovernorBravo::_castVoteInternal: voter already voted");

    uint96 votes = getPriorVotes(voter, proposal.startBlock);

    // CHANGES BASED ON CALLED CODE MADE: Use SafeMath "+" operator for adding votes
    if (support == 0) {
        proposal.againstVotes = proposal.againstVotes.add(votes);
    } else if (support == 1) {
        proposal.forVotes = proposal.forVotes.add(votes);
    } else if (support == 2) {
        proposal.abstainVotes = proposal.abstainVotes.add(votes);
    }

    receipt.hasVoted = true;
    receipt.support = support;
    receipt.votes = votes;

    emit VoteCast(voter, proposalId, support, votes, "");

    return votes;
}
