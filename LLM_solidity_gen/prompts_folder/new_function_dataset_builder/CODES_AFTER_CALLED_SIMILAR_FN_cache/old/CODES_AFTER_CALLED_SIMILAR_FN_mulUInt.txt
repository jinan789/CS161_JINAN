TASK 1:
I have analyzed your code, and it seems to be correct as per the given Task Description. There is no misuse of any functions or variables, and you have properly handled the integer overflow issue. 

TASK 2:
Since there are no issues found in TASK 1, there is no need to modify the given code. However, you can add more comments if needed for better understanding. Here is the original code with <CODE_BEGINNING> and <CODE_ENDING> tokens as requested:

<CODE_BEGINNING>
function mulUInt(uint a, uint b) internal pure returns (MathError errorCode, uint result) {
    // Check for overflow condition
    if (a == 0) {
        // If a is zero, the result is always zero, no overflow possible
        return (MathError.NO_ERROR, 0);
    }

    // Calculate the multiplication result
    uint256 c = a * b;

    // Check if the division result is equal to the original value of a, if not, it's an overflow
    if (c / a != b) {
        return (MathError.INTEGER_OVERFLOW, 0);
    }

    // If operation was successful, return no error and the multiplication result
    return (MathError.NO_ERROR, c);
}
<CODE_ENDING>
