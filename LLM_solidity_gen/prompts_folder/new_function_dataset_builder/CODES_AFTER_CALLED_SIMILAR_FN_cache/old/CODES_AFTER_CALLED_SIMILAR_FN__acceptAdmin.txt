Since there was no issue found in TASK 1, there is no modification needed, and your code remains the same:

<CODE_BEGINNING>
function _acceptAdmin() public returns (uint) {
    // Check if the caller is the pending admin and that the pending admin is not the zero address
    if (msg.sender != pendingAdmin || msg.sender == address(0)) {
        return fail(Error.UNAUTHORIZED, FailureInfo.ACCEPT_ADMIN_PENDING_ADMIN_CHECK);
    }

    // Update the admin to the value of the pending admin
    address oldAdmin = admin;
    admin = pendingAdmin;

    // Clear the pending admin value
    address oldPendingAdmin = pendingAdmin;
    pendingAdmin = address(0);

    // Emit events for the updated admin and pending admin
    emit NewAdmin(oldAdmin, admin);
    emit NewPendingAdmin(oldPendingAdmin, pendingAdmin);

    return uint(Error.NO_ERROR);
}
