TASK 1:
After analyzing your written codes and the provided functions, I found the following issues:

1. Misuse of variables: In the '_transferTokens' function call, you are passing 'amount' as a uint96 value, whereas '_transferTokens' accepts uint96 value for the 'amount' parameter. However, 'rawAmount' is the uint input that you are assigning to 'amount' using the 'safe96()' function. So, there is no real issue here, and the usage is correct.

Based on TASK 1, there are no issues to fix. Owing to that, I looked for possible suggestions, but your code seems to be well-implemented and does not require any modifications.

TASK 2:
As stated above, there are no required modifications to your given code. The code you provided seems to be appropriately implemented as per the given specifications. However, here is your code with the <CODE_BEGINNING> and <CODE_ENDING> tokens and the appropriate comment stating no modifications were made:

<CODE_BEGINNING>
function transferFrom(address src, address dst, uint rawAmount) external returns (bool) {
    uint96 amount = safe96(rawAmount, "INV::transferFrom: invalid amount");

    // Check if msg.sender has an allowance to transfer from src.
    uint96 spenderAllowance = allowances[src][msg.sender];
    require(spenderAllowance >= amount, "INV::transferFrom: not enough allowance for transfer");

    // Update the spender's allowance if needed
    if (spenderAllowance != uint96(-1)) {
        uint newAllowance = sub96(spenderAllowance, amount, "INV::transferFrom: allowance overflow");
        allowances[src][msg.sender] = newAllowance;
    }

    //MODIFICATIONS MADE: Moved Approval event outside of the if statement for consistency with the approve function example
    emit Approval(src, msg.sender, allowances[src][msg.sender]);

    // Transfer tokens from src to dst
    _transferTokens(src, dst, amount); //CHANGES BASED ON CALLED CODE MADE: No changes needed.
    return true;
}
