TASK 1: 
1. Issue: The function does not misuse any functions or variables. However, there is room for improvement. The function is missing a function modifier to indicate conformity with the ERC20 standard. The ERC20 standard requires the `approve` function to have a modifier `nonReentrant` to prevent reentrant attacks. 

Fix: Add `nonReentrant` modifier to the approve function.

TASK 2:
<CODE_BEGINNING>
// CHANGES BASED ON CALLED CODE MADE: Added the nonReentrant modifier to conform with the ERC20 standard and prevent reentrancy attacks
function approve(address spender, uint rawAmount) public nonReentrant returns (bool) {
    require(spender != address(0), "INV: approve to the zero address");
    uint96 amount = safe96(rawAmount, "INV: amount exceeds 96 bits");
    allowances[msg.sender][spender] = amount;

    emit Approval(msg.sender, spender, rawAmount);

    return true;
}
