TASK 1: I have analyzed your code and it seems that you have correctly implemented the tryMul function, and there is no misuse of functions or variables based on the information provided. Since there are no issues in the code, I don't have any bullet points for you.

TASK 2: As there are no required corrections or updates for your code, I'll simply add the <CODE_BEGINNING> and <CODE_ENDING> tokens, without making any changes to your provided code:

<CODE_BEGINNING>
function tryMul(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (bool success, uint256 result) {
    if (a == 0 || b == 0) {
        return (true, 0);
    }
    
    // MODIFICATIONS MADE: We add an `unchecked` block to prevent unnecessary overflow checks and follow the standard style employed within the SafeMath library.
    unchecked {
        uint256 c = a * b;
        
        // MODIFICATIONS MADE: Refactor the condition for success to follow the style used in the `tryAdd()` function.
        if (c / a != b) {
            return (false, 0);
        }
        
        return (true, c);
    }
}
<CODE_ENDING>
