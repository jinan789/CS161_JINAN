TASK 1:

1. The `_transferTokens` function is missing its state variables and events declarations. These should be part of the contract that the `_transferTokens` function will be implemented in.

2. The initial comment "// Check if the contract is tradable or the source address is whitelisted" might be incorrect, as it should say "AND" instead of "OR".

TASK 2:

Below is the updated version of your `_transferTokens` function with the necessary changes.

<CODE_BEGINNING>
function _transferTokens(address src, address dst, uint96 amount) internal {
    require(src != address(0), "INV:_transferTokens: cannot transfer from the zero address");
    require(dst != address(0), "INV:_transferTokens: cannot transfer to the zero address");

    // Check if the contract is tradable AND the source address is whitelisted
    if (!tradable) {
        require(whitelist[src], "INV:_transferTokens: source address is not whitelisted");
    }

    // Adjust balances
    // MODIFICATIONS MADE: Shortened the error message for consistency with other error messages.
    balances[src] = sub96(balances[src], amount, "INV:_transferTokens: amount exceeds balance");
    // MODIFICATIONS MADE: Shortened the error message for consistency with other error messages.
    balances[dst] = add96(balances[dst], amount, "INV:_transferTokens: amount overflows");

    // Move delegates
    _moveDelegates(delegates[src], delegates[dst], amount);

    // Emit Transfer event
    emit Transfer(src, dst, amount);
}
<CODE_ENDING>

Please make sure that you have declared the state variables (balances, delegates, tradable, whitelist) and the Transfer event in the contract that holds this function.
