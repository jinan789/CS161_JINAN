TASK 1: After analyzing the provided code and the related functions, I did not find any misuse of functions, variables, or other issues that need to be addressed.

TASK 2: Since there were no issues found in TASK 1, there is no need to modify the code. However, I will provide the code below again for your convenience, with <CODE_BEGINNING> and <CODE_ENDING> tokens as requested. 

<CODE_BEGINNING>
//MODIFICATIONS MADE: None
function _upgradeBeaconToAndCall(address newBeacon, bytes memory data, bool forceCall) internal {
    require(newBeacon != address(0), "ERC1967Upgrade: new beacon is the zero address");
    
    // Update the beacon address
    _setBeacon(newBeacon);

    // Emit the BeaconUpgraded event
    emit BeaconUpgraded(newBeacon);

    // Perform the delegate call if data length is greater than 0 or forceCall is true
    if (data.length > 0 || forceCall) {
        _functionDelegateCall(IBeaconUpgradeable(newBeacon).implementation(), data);
    }
}

event BeaconUpgraded(address indexed newBeacon);
<CODE_ENDING>
