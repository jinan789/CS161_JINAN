Based on my review of your code and the provided context, I did not find any misuse of functions, variables, etc. in your `liquidateBorrowInternal` function and the `liquidateBorrow` function. Both functions seem to be implemented correctly, based on the context provided.

However, the provided context did not include some important elements to fully validate your code. For example:

- The `liquidateBorrowFresh` function implementation is missing but it's used in your code. It's hard to determine if it's being used correctly without seeing its implementation.
- The definition of `CTokenInterface` is not provided. It's hard to guarantee that `cTokenCollateral.accrueInterest()` is a valid operation.
- The definition of the `Error` enum is not provided. It's hard to guarantee that `Error.NO_ERROR` is a valid value.

If you want a more thorough review, please provide these missing elements.

Here is your code anyway with the requested format:

```solidity
<CODE_BEGINNING>


function liquidateBorrowInternal(address liquidator, address borrower, uint repayAmount, CTokenInterface cTokenCollateral) internal returns (uint, uint) {
    // Accrue interest on the borrowed asset and the collateral asset
    uint errorCode = accrueInterest();
    if (errorCode != 0) {
        return (errorCode, 0);
    }
    errorCode = cTokenCollateral.accrueInterest();
    if (errorCode != 0) {
        return (errorCode, 0);
    }

    // Call liquidateBorrowFresh function to perform the process of repaying borrowed amount and seizing collateral
    (uint err, uint actualRepayAmount) = liquidateBorrowFresh(liquidator, borrower, repayAmount, cTokenCollateral);
    if (err != 0) {
        return (err, 0);
    }

    return (uint(Error.NO_ERROR), actualRepayAmount);
}

function liquidateBorrow(address borrower, uint repayAmount, CTokenInterface cTokenCollateral) external nonReentrant returns (uint, uint) {
    return liquidateBorrowInternal(msg.sender, borrower, repayAmount, cTokenCollateral);
}

<CODE_ENDING>
```

Please note that you should still do thorough testing to validate the correctness of your code.
