The two function signatures with the most similar functionality to the given target function (safeDecreaseAllowance) are:

1. safeApprove:

```solidity
function safeApprove(
    IERC20 token,
    address spender,
    uint256 value
) internal;
```

2. safeIncreaseAllowance:

```solidity
function safeIncreaseAllowance(
    IERC20 token,
    address spender,
    uint256 value
) internal;
```

These two functions are the most similar to the target function because they also involve modifying the allowance of a token spender, like the target function. However, safeApprove sets a new allowance value, while safeIncreaseAllowance and safeDecreaseAllowance increase and decrease the existing allowance, respectively.
