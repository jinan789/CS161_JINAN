The two function signatures that have the most similar functionality to the given target function are:

1. 
```javascript
function swap(
    address srcToken,
    uint256 srcAmount,
    uint256 minPrice,
    uint256 maxPrice,
    address destToken,
    bytes memory oneInchData
) public onlyDao returns (
    uint256 actualDestAmount,
    uint256 actualSrcAmount
);
```

2.
```javascript
function _calcRateFromQty(
    uint256 srcAmount,
    uint256 destAmount,
    uint256 srcDecimals,
    uint256 dstDecimals
) internal pure returns (uint256)
```

The first function signature, `swap`, has a similar functionality as it deals with swapping tokens and also returns the actual destination amount and actual source amount, which closely matches with the target function's return values.

The second function signature, `_calcRateFromQty`, is also related to the target function as it is being used within the target function to calculate prices (the srcPriceInDest and destPriceInSrc variables).
