TASK 1: Step-by-Step Plan
1. Declare the function signature for mul, taking two input variables `a` and `b` of type uint256, and returning a uint256 variable.

2. Inside the function, check for the base case where the input variable `a` is equal to 0. If `a` is 0, multiplication would lead to 0, so return 0 immediately.

3. Proceed with multiplication by multiplying `a` and `b`, and storing the result in a new variable `c`.

4. To check for multiplication overflow, divide the result `c` by the input variable `a`. If the result of this division is equal to the input variable `b`, this implies that no overflow has occurred. If not, throw an error message using a require statement.

5. If the overflow check has passed, return the result `c` as the output of the function.


Now, we'll check if the provided function follows these steps correctly. After reviewing the code, it appears that it follows the step-by-step plan accurately and should work as intended under the context of the given contract from Information 1. No further corrections or updates seem necessary.

Here's the reviewed code for reference:
```solidity
function mul(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {
    // Check for overflow condition (Step 2)
    if (a == 0) {
        return 0;
    }

    uint256 c = a * b; // Perform multiplication (Step 3)

    // Check for overflow and throw error message if needed (Step 4)
    require(c / a == b, "SafeMath: multiplication overflow");

    return c; // Return the result after successful overflow check (Step 5)
}
```
