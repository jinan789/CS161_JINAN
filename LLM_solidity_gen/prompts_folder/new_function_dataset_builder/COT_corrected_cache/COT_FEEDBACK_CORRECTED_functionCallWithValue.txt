Before we jump into the code improvements, here's the step-by-step plan based on the given information:

1. Check if the contract's balance is greater than or equal to the provided value. If not, revert the transaction with an error message.
2. Check if the target address is a contract using the isContract() function. If not, revert the transaction with an error message.
3. Execute the call to the target address with the provided data and value, and store the success status and return data.
4. Verify the call result using the verifyCallResult() function, which should either return the returndata or revert with the provided errorMessage.

Now, let's analyze and modify your provided code according to the step-by-step plan.

Your provided code looks correct according to the plan, but we can make one small improvement to the code: remove the balance checking step since the Solidity call function will throw an error if there's an insufficient balance. Here's the updated code:

```solidity
function functionCallWithValue(
    address target,
    bytes memory data,
    uint256 value,
    string memory errorMessage
) internal returns (bytes memory) {
    // Remove this section as the Solidity 'call' function will check the balance automatically
    //require(
    //    address(this).balance >= value,
    //    "Address: insufficient balance for call"
    //);

    require(
        isContract(target),
        "Address: target is not a contract"
    );

    (bool success, bytes memory returndata) = target.call{value: value}(data);
    return verifyCallResult(success, returndata, errorMessage);
}
```

This updated code follows the step-by-step plan and looks correct. The balance check has been removed, as the built-in call function already provides a check for insufficient funds.
