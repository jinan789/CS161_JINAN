TASK 1: Step-by-step plan for the functionality described in Information 2:

1. Ensure that the `amount` to be transferred is greater than 0, as transferring 0 tokens is considered a failure.
2. Construct the 'transaction' for the transferFrom function, with the specified `from`, `to`, and `amount` as inputs.
3. Call the token contract with the constructed transaction.
4. Check if the transaction was successful, and return an error message if it was not.
5. If the transaction has a return value, ensure that it corresponds to a successful transfer, and return an error message if it does not.

Now, let's check and improve the provided code based on the step-by-step plan:

```solidity
function safeTransferFrom(
    ERC20 token,
    address from,
    address to,
    uint256 amount
) internal {
    // Step 1: Ensure that the amount to be transferred is greater than 0
    require(amount > 0, "TRANSFER_AMOUNT_ZERO");

    // Step 2: Construct the transaction for the transferFrom function
    bytes4 private constant SELECTOR = bytes4(keccak256(bytes("transferFrom(address,address,uint256)")));
    bytes memory callData = abi.encodeWithSelector(SELECTOR, from, to, amount);

    // Step 3: Call the token contract with the constructed transaction
    (bool success, bytes memory returndata) = address(token).call(callData);

    // Step 4: Check if the transaction was successful
    require(success, "TRANSFER_FROM_FAILED");

    // Step 5: If the transaction has a return value, ensure that it corresponds to a successful transfer
    if (returndata.length > 0) {
        require(abi.decode(returndata, (bool)), "TRANSFER_FROM_FAILED");
    }
}
```

The provided code includes all the necessary steps outlined in the plan and appears to be correct in terms of functionality. The only change made was the addition of a check to ensure the `amount` to be transferred is greater than 0.
