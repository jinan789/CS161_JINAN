TASK 1: Step-by-Step Plan

1. Store the current implementation in a variable, by calling the _getImplementation() function.
2. Upgrade to the new implementation using the input address parameter by calling the _upgradeTo() function.
3. Perform a delegate call to the new implementation with the provided data input parameter.
4. Check the success of the delegate call.
   a. If the call is successful, simply keep the new implementation.
   b. If the call is NOT successful, AND forceCall input parameter is true, still keep the new implementation.
   c. If the call is NOT successful, AND forceCall input parameter is NOT true, then revert the upgrade, restore the previous implementation, and revert the transaction with an error message.

Here is the updated function code that ensures all steps are followed in a logical order:

```solidity
function _upgradeToAndCallSecure(
    address newImplementation,
    bytes memory data,
    bool forceCall
) internal {
    // Step 1: Store the current implementation before upgrading
    address currentImplementation = _getImplementation();

    // Step 2: Upgrade to the new implementation
    _upgradeTo(newImplementation);

    // Step 3: Perform a delegate call with the provided data
    (bool success, bytes memory result) = newImplementation.delegatecall(data);

    // Step 4: Check the success or failure of the delegate call
    if (success || forceCall) {
        // Step 4a and 4b: If successful or forceCall is true, keep the new implementation
        return;
    } else {
        // Step 4c: Revert the upgrade and restore the previous implementation if the call fails
        _upgradeTo(currentImplementation);

        // Revert the transaction and return the error message from the failed delegate call
        revert(string(abi.encodePacked("Upgrade failed: ", result)));
    }
}
```

With these adjustments, the given function now follows the step-by-step plan and should be correct based on the provided task description.
