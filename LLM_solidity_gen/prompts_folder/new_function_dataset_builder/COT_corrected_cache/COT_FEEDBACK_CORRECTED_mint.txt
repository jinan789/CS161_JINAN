TASK 1:

Here's a step-wise plan to implement the mint function as given in Information 2:

Step 1: Check if the destination address is not equal to the zero address.
Step 2: Add the rawAmount to the totalSupply using SafeMath library.
Step 3: Update the recipient's balance by adding the rawAmount to their current balance.
Step 4: Move the delegates from the zero address to the recipient's address.
Step 5: Emit a Transfer event to log the minting of tokens.

Now, I will analyze the provided code and make appropriate improvements if needed:

Your provided code for the mint() function:
```
function mint(address dst, uint rawAmount) external onlyOwner {
    require(dst != address(0), "INV: cannot mint tokens to the zero address");

    // Update total supply of tokens
    totalSupply = SafeMath.add(totalSupply, rawAmount);

    // Transfer the newly minted tokens to the specified address
    balances[dst] = add96(balances[dst], safe96(rawAmount, "INV: transfer amount overflows"), "INV: transfer amount overflows");

    // Update the delegates of the recipient address
    _moveDelegates(address(0), delegates[dst], safe96(rawAmount, "INV: transfer amount overflows"));

    // Emit the transfer event
    emit Transfer(address(0), dst, rawAmount);
}
```
While analyzing the provided code, I found that it follows the exact steps in a logical manner. Hence, there is no need to make any updates to the given codes.

Here is the function code once more for your reference, as it is consistent with the steps provided:

```
function mint(address dst, uint rawAmount) external onlyOwner {
    require(dst != address(0), "INV: cannot mint tokens to the zero address");

    // Update total supply of tokens
    totalSupply = SafeMath.add(totalSupply, rawAmount);

    // Transfer the newly minted tokens to the specified address
    balances[dst] = add96(balances[dst], safe96(rawAmount, "INV: transfer amount overflows"), "INV: transfer amount overflows");

    // Update the delegates of the recipient address
    _moveDelegates(address(0), delegates[dst], safe96(rawAmount, "INV: transfer amount overflows"));

    // Emit the transfer event
    emit Transfer(address(0), dst, rawAmount);
}
```
