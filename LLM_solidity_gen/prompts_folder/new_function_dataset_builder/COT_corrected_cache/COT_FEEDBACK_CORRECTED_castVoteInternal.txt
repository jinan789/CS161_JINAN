TASK 1: Step-by-step plan for castVoteInternal function

1. Check the current state of the proposal with the given proposalId, ensure the state is "Active" (ProposalState.Active)
2. Verify that the support value is within the allowed range (0, 1, or 2)
3. Check if the voter (msg.sender) is not a top staker (using the isWhitelisted() function)
4. Retrieve the proposal storage based on the proposalId
5. Validate if the voter has not voted for this proposal already (using the proposal's receipts mapping)
6. Get the number of votes (voting power) the voter has at the proposal's startBlock (using the getPriorVotes() function)
7. Update the proposal's total votes (against, for, or abstain) based on the support value and the voter's voting power
8. Update the receipt with the following information: set hasVoted to true, set support with the given voting option, and set votes with the voter's voting power
9. Emit a VoteCast event with the voter's address, proposalId, support, votes, and an empty reason string.
10. Return the number of votes by the voter

Now we will compare these steps with the provided code and make improvements if necessary.

Based on the given code, all the necessary steps are already included. The steps are presented in a logical way and cover the necessary functionality described in the task summary. It appears that the code correctly implements the intended functionality without the need for any further updates.

Here is the provided code for reference:

```solidity
function castVoteInternal(address voter, uint proposalId, uint8 support) public returns (uint256) {
    require(state(proposalId) == ProposalState.Active, "GovernorBravo::_castVoteInternal: voting is closed");
    require(support <= 2, "GovernorBravo::_castVoteInternal: invalid voting option");
    require(!isWhitelisted(msg.sender),"GovernorBravo::_castVoteInternal: Top stakers cannot cast vote");

    Proposal storage proposal = proposals[proposalId];
    Receipt storage receipt = proposal.receipts[voter];
    require(receipt.hasVoted == false, "GovernorBravo::_castVoteInternal: voter already voted");

    uint96 votes = getPriorVotes(voter, proposal.startBlock);

    if (support == 0) {
        proposal.againstVotes = add256(proposal.againstVotes, votes);
    } else if (support == 1) {
        proposal.forVotes = add256(proposal.forVotes, votes);
    } else if (support == 2) {
        proposal.abstainVotes = add256(proposal.abstainVotes, votes);
    }

    receipt.hasVoted = true;
    receipt.support = support;
    receipt.votes = votes;

    emit VoteCast(voter, proposalId, support, votes, "");

    return votes;
}
```

No further modifications are needed, since the code follows the step-by-step plan and implements the intended functionality.
