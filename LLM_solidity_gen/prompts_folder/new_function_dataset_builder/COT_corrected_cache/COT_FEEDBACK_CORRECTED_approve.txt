TASK 1: Step-by-step plan for the approve function:

1. Validate if the spender's address is not the zero address (to avoid wasting gas and emitting events to the zero address).
2. Convert the rawAmount (uint) provided to a uint96 value, ensuring it does not exceed the maximum allowable limit (96 bits).
3. Update the approval allowance by setting the allowance of the spender for the message sender (msg.sender) to the amount converted in step 2.
4. Emit an Approval event to record the approval transaction, containing the message sender's address, spender's address, and the rawAmount approved.
5. Return true as a boolean value to indicate the success of the operation.

Now let's examine your provided code and make any necessary improvements:

function approve(address spender, uint rawAmount) public returns (bool) {
    require(spender != address(0), "INV: approve to the zero address");
    uint96 amount = safe96(rawAmount, "INV: amount exceeds 96 bits");
    allowances[msg.sender][spender] = amount;

    emit Approval(msg.sender, spender, rawAmount);

    return true;
}

After analyzing the code, it seems that all the steps are organized in a logical and coherent manner. Your code implementation correctly follows the step-by-step plan listed above.

The code does the following:
1. It checks if the spender's address is not the zero address.
2. It converts the rawAmount to a uint96 value safely using the "safe96" function to ensure it does not exceed 96 bits.
3. Sets the allowance for the spender on behalf of the message sender (msg.sender) to the calculated amount.
4. Emits the Approval event with the necessary information.
5. Returns true to indicate that the function executed successfully.

Overall, your implementation aligns with the contract requirements and the approve function's intended functionalities. There is no need for any changes or improvements to the given code. Good job!
