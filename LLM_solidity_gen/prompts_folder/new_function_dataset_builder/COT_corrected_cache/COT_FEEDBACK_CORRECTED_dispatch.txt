Alright, let's first establish a clear plan based on the information provided and then we will use this plan to improve the provided Solidity code.

## TASK 1: Planning

#### Step 1: 
Validate the `commandType` input. The `commandType` should be one of the predefined command types. If it's not, throw an error.

#### Step 2:
Decode the `inputs` based on the `commandType`. Depending on the command, different data may need to be extracted from the `inputs`.

#### Step 3: 
Execute the command based on the `commandType`. Depending on the command type, different actions need to be taken. Some of these actions might require the result of the decoding step. 

#### Step 4:
Check postconditions. These checks are also dependent on the command type. For instance, after transferring an ERC721 token, we need to verify that the token owner has changed. After transferring an ERC1155 token, we need to ensure the recipient's balance has increased.

#### Step 5:
Return the results. This includes a boolean indicating whether the operation was successful and possibly some output data.

## TASK 2: Code Review and Improvement

Let's now apply this plan to your code. Here are the improvements I would make:

```solidity
function dispatch(bytes1 commandType, bytes calldata inputs) 
    external 
    onlyWrapperOrThis
    returns (bool success, bytes memory output) 
{
    // Step 1: Validate commandType
    if (!Commands.isValidCommand(commandType)) {
        revert InvalidCommandType(uint256(commandType));
    }

    // Step 2: Decode inputs
    // This step is integrated within each command execution, as it depends on the commandType

    // Step 3: Execute command
    if (commandType == Commands.Token.TransferERC20.selector[0]) {
        success = _transferERC20(inputs);
    } else if (commandType == Commands.Token.TransferERC721.selector[0]) {
        success = _transferERC721(inputs);
    } else if (commandType == Commands.Token.TransferERC1155.selector[0]) {
        success = _transferERC1155(inputs);
    } else if (commandType == Commands.Token.ApproveERC20.selector[0]) {
        success = _approveERC20(inputs);
    } else if (commandType == Commands.Token.ApproveERC721.selector[0]) {
        success = _approveERC721(inputs);
    } else if (commandType == Commands.Token.ApproveERC1155.selector[0]) {
        success = _approveERC1155(inputs);
    } else if (commandType == Commands.Swaps.SwapV2Proceeds.selector[0]) {
        (success, output) = _swapV2Proceeds(inputs);
    } else if (commandType == Commands.Swaps.SwapV3Proceeds.selector[0]) {
        (success, output) = _swapV3Proceeds(inputs);
    }

    // Step 4: Check postconditions
    if (success) {
        if (commandType == Commands.Token.TransferERC721.selector[0]) {
            address from;
            address to;
            uint256 tokenId;
            (from, to, tokenId) = abi.decode(inputs, (address, address, uint256));
            
            // Check if the token has been transferred
            if (ERC721(from).ownerOf(tokenId) != to) {
                revert InvalidOwnerERC721();
            }
        } else if (commandType == Commands.Token.TransferERC1155.selector[0]) {
            address from;
            address to;
            uint256 tokenId;
            uint256 value;
            (from, to, tokenId, value) = abi.decode(inputs, (address, address, uint256, uint256));
            
            // Check if the balance has been updated
            if (ERC1155(from).balanceOf(to, tokenId) < value) {
                revert BalanceTooLow();
            }
        }
    }

    // Step 5: Return results
    return (success, output);
}
```

Key changes:

1. Added a call to `Commands.isValidCommand(commandType)` to validate the commandType upfront.
2. Changed the ERC721 and ERC1155 postcondition checks to use the sender address (`from`) instead of `msg.sender`. This is because `msg.sender` is the address of the contract calling this function, not the address of the token sender.

Please note that the `Commands.isValidCommand(commandType)` function doesn't exist and you would have to implement it. Also, the `_transferERC20`, `_transferERC721`, `_transferERC1155`, `_approveERC20`, `_approveERC721`, `_approveERC1155`, `_swapV2Proceeds`, and `_swapV3Proceeds` functions are assumed to exist and decode inputs appropriately. If they don't, they will also need to be implemented.
