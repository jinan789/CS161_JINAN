TASK 1: Step-by-Step Plan
1. Check if the provided inputs are valid, i.e., token is an ERC20 token, to is a valid address, and amount is a positive value.
2. Call the approve function on the token contract and store the return value to check its success.
3. Check the return value, which should be empty or true. If the approval process fails (i.e., the return value is false or the success variable is false), revert the transaction with the "APPROVE_FAILED" message.
4. If the approval is successful, the function ends without any output.

Now, let's check if each step is present in the given code and update it if necessary:

```solidity
function safeApprove(
    ERC20 token,
    address to,
    uint256 amount
) internal {
    // Validate input (Step 1)
    require(token != ERC20(0), "INVALID_TOKEN");
    require(to != address(0), "INVALID_ADDRESS");
    require(amount > 0, "INVALID_AMOUNT");

    // Call approve function on the token contract and store the success value (Step 2)
    (bool success, bytes memory data) = address(token).call(
        abi.encodeWithSelector(token.approve.selector, to, amount)
    );

    // Check the return value is empty or true (Step 3)
    if (
        !success
        || (data.length > 0 && abi.decode(data, (bool)) == false)
    ) {
        revert("APPROVE_FAILED");
    }

    // If the approval is successful, the function ends without any output (Step 4)
}
```

I have added input validation (Step 1) to ensure that the input is correct before executing the rest of the code. Other than this addition, the given code is well-written and matches the plan.
