TASK 1: Step-by-step plan to perform the functionality described in the provided summaries:

1. Retrieve the current allowance value by calling the `allowance` function on the provided `IERC20` token instance with the current contract address and the provided `spender` address as arguments.
2. Check if the current allowance value is greater than or equal to the provided `value` by using a `require` statement with an appropriate error message.
3. Calculate the new allowance value by subtracting the provided `value` from the current allowance value.
4. Approve the new allowance value for the spender by encoding the `approve` function call on the provided `IERC20` token instance with the spender address and the new allowance value as arguments.
5. Call the `_callOptionalReturn` function with the `IERC20` token instance and the encoded `approve` function call from the previous step.

Now I will check if all these steps are implemented correctly in your provided code:

```
function safeDecreaseAllowance(
    IERC20 token,
    address spender,
    uint256 value
) internal {
    uint256 currentAllowance = token.allowance(address(this), spender); // Step 1
    require(currentAllowance >= value, "SafeERC20: decreased allowance below zero"); // Step 2
    uint256 newAllowance = currentAllowance - value; // Step 3
    _callOptionalReturn(token, abi.encodeWithSelector(token.approve.selector, spender, newAllowance)); // Steps 4 and 5
}
```

Your provided code correctly follows all the steps mentioned in the plan. Therefore, no further changes are required.
