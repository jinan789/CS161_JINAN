TASK 1: Step-by-Step Plan to perform the getAccountSnapshot functionality

1. Retrieve the cToken balance of the given account by calling the balanceOf function with the account address as an input parameter.
2. Get the borrow balance of the given account by calling the borrowBalanceStoredInternal function with the account address as an input parameter. Check for any math error returned by the function.
3. If there's a math error in borrow balance calculation, return an error tuple with the error code set to "MATH_ERROR" and other values set to 0.
4. Calculate the current exchange rate mantissa by calling the exchangeRateStoredInternal function. Check for any math error returned by the function.
5. If there's a math error in the exchange rate mantissa calculation, return an error tuple with the error code set to "MATH_ERROR" and other values set to 0.
6. If there are no math errors, return a tuple containing the error code "NO_ERROR", the cToken balance, the borrow balance, and the exchange rate mantissa.

Now, let's check the given code and perform improvements based on the plan.

Improved Code:

```solidity
function getAccountSnapshot(address account) public view returns (uint, uint, uint, uint) {
    // Step 1: Retrieve cToken balance
    uint cTokenBal = balanceOf(account);

    // Step 2: Get borrow balance and check for math errors
    (MathError mathErr, uint borrowBal) = borrowBalanceStoredInternal(account);
    if (mathErr != MathError.NO_ERROR) {
        // Step 3: Return error tuple if there's a math error in borrow balance calculation
        return (uint(Error.MATH_ERROR), 0, 0, 0);
    }

    // Step 4: Calculate exchange rate mantissa and check for math errors
    (MathError exchangeRateMathErr, uint exchangeRateMantissa) = exchangeRateStoredInternal();
    if (exchangeRateMathErr != MathError.NO_ERROR) {
        // Step 5: Return error tuple if there's a math error in exchange rate mantissa calculation
        return (uint(Error.MATH_ERROR), 0, 0, 0);
    }

    // Step 6: Return the result tuple if there are no math errors
    return (uint(Error.NO_ERROR), cTokenBal, borrowBal, exchangeRateMantissa);
}
```

I have reviewed your provided code, and it seems correct based on the step-by-step plan I outlined. Since your code already followed the proper steps, I did not make any updates to the given code.
