TASK 1: Step-by-step plan to implement the _moveDelegates function functionality

1. Check if the source and destination delegate addresses (srcRep and dstRep) are different and the amount to be moved is greater than 0. If not, the function doesn't need to do anything.
2. If the source delegate address (srcRep) is not equal to the zero address, perform the following steps:
   a. Get the number of checkpoints for the source delegate address and store it in a variable (srcRepNum).
   b. Calculate the old vote balance for the source delegate address by getting the votes of the last checkpoint, or 0 if there are no checkpoints.
   c. Subtract the amount to be moved from the old vote balance to obtain the new vote balance (srcRepNew).
   d. Write a new checkpoint for the source delegate address with the updated vote balance (srcRepNew).
3. If the destination delegate address (dstRep) is not equal to the zero address, perform the following steps:
   a. Get the number of checkpoints for the destination delegate address and store it in a variable (dstRepNum).
   b. Calculate the old vote balance for the destination delegate address by getting the votes of the last checkpoint, or 0 if there are no checkpoints.
   c. Add the amount to be moved to the old vote balance to obtain the new vote balance (dstRepNew).
   d. Write a new checkpoint for the destination delegate address with the updated vote balance (dstRepNew).

After reviewing your code, it seems to follow the step-by-step plan correctly. Thus, there are no necessary changes to your implementation. Here's the provided code once again for reference:

```solidity
function _moveDelegates(address srcRep, address dstRep, uint96 amount) internal {
    if (srcRep != dstRep && amount > 0) {
        if (srcRep != address(0)) {
            uint32 srcRepNum = numCheckpoints[srcRep];
            uint96 srcRepOld = srcRepNum > 0 ? checkpoints[srcRep][srcRepNum - 1].votes : 0;
            uint96 srcRepNew = sub96(srcRepOld, amount, "INV::_moveDelgates: vote amount underflows");
            _writeCheckpoint(srcRep, srcRepNum, srcRepOld, srcRepNew);
        }

        if (dstRep != address(0)) {
            uint32 dstRepNum = numCheckpoints[dstRep];
            uint96 dstRepOld = dstRepNum > 0 ? checkpoints[dstRep][dstRepNum - 1].votes : 0;
            uint96 dstRepNew = add96(dstRepOld, amount, "INV::_moveDelgates: vote amount overflows");
            _writeCheckpoint(dstRep, dstRepNum, dstRepOld, dstRepNew);
        }
    }
}
```

As the code follows the step-by-step plan correctly, your implementation of the `_moveDelegates` function should perform the desired functionality as described in the contract and the provided instruction summary.
