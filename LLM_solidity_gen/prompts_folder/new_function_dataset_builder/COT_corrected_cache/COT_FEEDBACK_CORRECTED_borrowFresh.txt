Sure, let's break down the tasks required for implementing the `borrowFresh` function according to the specification and context provided.

Step-by-Step Plan:

1. Call `accrueInterest` to update the interest rates.
2. Get the account liquidity of the borrower by calling the `comptroller.getAccountLiquidity` function. This will return three variables: `allowed`, `liquidity`, and `shortfall`.
3. Check if the borrower is allowed to borrow. This is determined by the `allowed` variable (it should be equal to 0) and the `shortfall` variable (it should also be equal to 0). If one of these conditions is not met, return an error code indicating that the borrow request was rejected by the comptroller.
4. Get the current block number by calling the `getBlockNumber` function. 
5. Validate that the current block number is not the same as the `borrowIndex` to avoid repetitive calculations for the same block. If they are equal, return an error code indicating that the calculation of the accumulated balance has failed.
6. Check the contract's cash balance by calling the `getCash` function.
7. Make sure that the contract has enough cash to fulfill the borrow request. If it doesn't, return an error code indicating that there's insufficient cash.
8. Transfer the requested amount to the borrower by calling the `doTransferOut` function.
9. Update the borrower's borrow balance. This involves calculating the accrued borrow amount, adding it to the borrower's current principal, and then updating the borrower's `BorrowSnapshot` struct.
10. Update the `totalBorrows` of the contract by adding the `borrowAmount` to the current `totalBorrows`.
11. Emit a `Borrow` event with the borrower's address, the borrow amount, and the borrower's principal before and after the transaction.
12. If all steps are executed without any errors, return an error code indicating that there's no error.

Based on this plan, here's the improved code:

```solidity
function borrowFresh(address payable borrower, uint borrowAmount) external nonReentrant returns (uint) {
    // Step 1: Update the interest rates
    accrueInterest();

    // Step 2: Get the borrower's account liquidity
    (uint allowed, uint liquidity, uint shortfall) = comptroller.getAccountLiquidity(borrower);

    // Step 3: Check if the borrower is allowed to borrow
    if (allowed != 0 || shortfall != 0) {
        return fail(Error.BORROW_COMPTROLLER_REJECTION, FailureInfo.BORROW_COMPTROLLER_REJECTION);
    }

    // Step 4: Get the current block number
    uint currentBlockNumber = getBlockNumber();

    // Step 5: Validate the current block number
    if (borrowIndex == currentBlockNumber) {
        return fail(Error.BORROW_ACCUMULATED_BALANCE_CALCULATION_FAILED, FailureInfo.BORROW_ACCUMULATED_BALANCE_CALCULATION_FAILED);
    }

    // Step 6: Check the contract's cash balance
    uint cash = getCash();

    // Step 7: Check if the contract has enough cash
    if (cash < borrowAmount) {
        return fail(Error.TOKEN_INSUFFICIENT_CASH, FailureInfo.BORROW_INSUFFICIENT_CASH);
    }

    // Step 8: Transfer the requested amount to the borrower
    doTransferOut(borrower, borrowAmount);

    // Step 9: Update the borrower's borrow balance
    BorrowSnapshot storage borrowSnapshot = accountBorrows[borrower];
    uint principalBefore = borrowSnapshot.principal;
    MathError mathErr;
    uint accruedBorrowAmount;
    (mathErr, accruedBorrowAmount) = mulScalar(borrowAmount, borrowIndex);
    if (mathErr != MathError.NO_ERROR) {
        return failOpaque(Error.MATH_ERROR, FailureInfo.BORROW_ACCUMULATED_BALANCE_CALCULATION_FAILED, uint(mathErr));
    }
    uint principalAfter = principalBefore.add(accruedBorrowAmount);
    borrowSnapshot.principal = principalAfter;
    borrowSnapshot.interestIndex = borrowIndex;

    // Step 10: Update the total borrows
    totalBorrows = totalBorrows.add(borrowAmount);

    // Step 11: Emit a Borrow event
    emit Borrow(borrower, borrowAmount, principalBefore, principalAfter);

    // Step 12: Return no error
    return uint(Error.NO_ERROR);
}
```

This code now follows the step-by-step plan and should correctly perform the intended functionality according to the given specifications.
