TASK 1: Step-by-step plan

1. Retrieve the borrower's borrow snapshot from the `accountBorrows` mapping using the given `account` address.
2. Check if the borrower's borrow snapshot principal is 0, and if so, return with a 0 borrow balance (since there is no debt).
3. Retrieve the current borrow index from the `borrowIndex` variable.
4. Multiply the borrower's borrow snapshot principal with the current borrow index.
5. Check for any math errors during the multiplication. In case of an error, return with the error code and a 0 borrow balance.
6. Divide the result of the multiplication by the borrower's borrow snapshot index to get the borrower's borrow balance.
7. Check for any math errors during the division. In case of an error, return with the error code and a 0 borrow balance.
8. If no errors were encountered in the calculations, return the borrower's borrow balance along with a NO_ERROR code.

Now, let's analyze the provided code and fix it according to the step-by-step plan.

Corrected function implementation:

```solidity
function borrowBalanceStoredInternal(address account) internal view returns (MathError errorCode, uint borrowBalance) {
    // Step 1: Get the account's borrow snapshot
    BorrowSnapshot storage borrowSnapshot = accountBorrows[account];

    // Step 2: If the account's borrow balance is 0, return 0
    if (borrowSnapshot.principal == 0) {
        return (MathError.NO_ERROR, 0);
    }

    // Step 3: Calculate the account's borrow balance based on the current borrow index
    uint currentBorrowIndex = borrowIndex;

    // Step 4: Multiply the borrower's borrow snapshot principal with the current borrow index
    uint principalTimesIndex;
    (errorCode, principalTimesIndex) = mulUInt(borrowSnapshot.principal, currentBorrowIndex);

    // Step 5: Check for math errors during multiplication
    if (errorCode != MathError.NO_ERROR) {
        return (errorCode, 0);
    }

    // Step 6: Divide the result by the borrow snapshot index to get the borrow balance
    uint result;
    (errorCode, result) = divUInt(principalTimesIndex, borrowSnapshot.index);

    // Step 7: Check for math errors during division
    if (errorCode != MathError.NO_ERROR) {
        return (errorCode, 0);
    }

    // Step 8: Return the borrow balance with a NO_ERROR code
    return (MathError.NO_ERROR, result);
}
```
The corrected code follows the step-by-step plan and properly handles math errors.
