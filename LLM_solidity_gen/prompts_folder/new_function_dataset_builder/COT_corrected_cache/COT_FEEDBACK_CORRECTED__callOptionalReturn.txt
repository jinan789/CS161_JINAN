TASK 1: Step-by-step plan to perform the functionality described in the provided summaries:

1. Check if the address of the given token is a contract. If not, revert with the message "SafeERC20: call to non-contract".

2. Perform a low-level call to the ERC20 token contract using the provided call data (bypassing Solidity's return data size checking mechanism).

3. Check if the low-level call was successful or not. If not, follow the next steps for handling the failure.
   a. Check if there is any return data.
   b. If return data is present, use assembly to extract the revert reason from the return data and revert the transaction with the extracted reason.
   c. If return data is not present, revert the transaction with the message "SafeERC20: low-level call failed".

4. If the call was successful, check if there is any return data.
   a. If return data is present, decode the return data to a boolean value and check if the operation in the ERC20 token contract was successful or not.
   b. If the operation was not successful, revert the transaction with the message "SafeERC20: ERC20 operation did not succeed".

After analyzing your provided code, it appears to follow the plan mentioned above. No improvements are necessary. The code seems to be logically and coherently implementing the desired functionality as described in the given function summary (Information 2).
