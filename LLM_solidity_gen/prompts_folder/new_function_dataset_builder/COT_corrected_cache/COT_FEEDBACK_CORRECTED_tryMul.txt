TASK 1: Step-by-step plan for the tryMul function

1. Start by defining the function tryMul with its input parameters (a and b) and output parameters (success and result).

2. Check for the case where either a or b is zero. If either of the inputs is zero, return true immediately as multiplication with zero cannot cause an overflow.

3. Perform the multiplication of a and b, and store the result in variable c.

4. To check for overflow, divide the product (c) by one of the inputs (a or b). If the result is equal to the other input, then there was no overflow.

5. If there was no overflow, return true along with the product of the multiplication (c).

6. If there was an overflow, return false and a result of 0.

Now, let's compare this plan with the provided code snippet:

    function tryMul(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (bool success, uint256 result) {
        if (a == 0 || b == 0) { // Step 2
            return (true, 0);
        }
        
        uint256 c = a * b; // Step 3

        // Step 4 & Step 5
        if (c / a == b) { 
            return (true, c);
        } else { // Step 6
            return (false, 0);
        }
    }

The provided code snippet correctly follows the steps outlined in the plan. There are no improvements necessary as the code efficiently implements the desired functionality.
