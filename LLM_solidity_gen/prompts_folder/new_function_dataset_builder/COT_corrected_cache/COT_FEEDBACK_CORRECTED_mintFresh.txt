TASK 1: Step-by-step plan for the mintFresh function:

1. Check if the mint operation is allowed by calling `controller.allowMint()` with the contract address, minter address, and mintAmount as inputs. 
   - If the returned error is not equal to Error.NO_ERROR, return the error code and 0 as actual mintAmount.

2. Check for market freshness by calling `isFresh()` and:
   - If market is not fresh, return the error code for MARKET_NOT_FRESH (uint(Error.MARKET_NOT_FRESH)) and 0 as actual mintAmount.

3. Calculate the current exchange rate by calling `exchangeRateStoredInternal()`.
   - If the returned MathError is not equal to MathError.NO_ERROR, return the error code for MATH_ERROR (uint(Error.MATH_ERROR)) and 0 as actual mintAmount.

4. Calculate the number of cTokens to be minted using the mintAmount and calculated exchange rate as inputs, by calling `divScalarByExpTruncate()`.
   - If the returned MathError is not equal to MathError.NO_ERROR, return the error code for MATH_ERROR (uint(Error.MATH_ERROR)) and 0 as actual mintAmount.

5. Update the totalSupply of tokens by adding the number of cTokensToMint to the current totalSupply.
6. Update the minter's balance of tokens by adding the number of cTokensToMint to their current balance in accountTokens mapping.
7. Emit the Mint event with the minter, mintAmount, cTokensToMint, and exchangeRateMantissa as inputs.
8. Emit the Transfer event to log the transfer of cTokensToMint from the contract address to the minter.
9. Return the error code for NO_ERROR (uint(Error.NO_ERROR)) and the number of cTokensToMint as actual mintAmount.

The given function codes seem to follow the exact step-by-step plan for implementing the intended functionality. Therefore, I do not see any necessary improvements or updates to be made at this moment.
