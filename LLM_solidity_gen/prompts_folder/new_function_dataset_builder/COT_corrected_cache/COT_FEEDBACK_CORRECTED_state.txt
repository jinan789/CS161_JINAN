Given the information provided, here's a step-by-step plan to execute the functionality as described:

1. Retrieve the proposal using the `proposalId` from the `proposals` mapping. This is necessary because we need to assess the state of the specific proposal in question.

2. Check if the proposal has been canceled. If it has been canceled, return the `Canceled` state.

3. If the proposal is not canceled, check if the current block number is less than or equal to the proposal's start block. If it is, return the `Pending` state.

4. If the proposal has started, check if the current block number is less than or equal to the proposal's end block. If it is, return the `Active` state.

5. If the proposal is not active, check if the proposal has been defeated. A proposal is defeated if the votes against are more than or equal to the votes for, or if the votes for are less than the quorum votes. If it is defeated, return the `Defeated` state.

6. If the proposal is not defeated, and it has been executed, return the `Executed` state.

7. If the proposal is not executed, check if it is queued. If the timelock's pending function returns a non-zero value for the proposalId, it is in the `Queued` state.

8. If the proposal is not queued, check if it's expiration is pending. If the timelock's timestamp function returns a value greater than the current block timestamp for the proposalId, it is in the `Pending` state.

9. If the proposal is not expiring, check if it has been executed after the expiration time. If the timelock's timestamp function returns a non-zero value for the proposalId, it is in the `Executed` state.

10. If the proposal is not executed after the expiration time, check if it has expired. If the timelock's timestamp function returns a zero value for the proposalId, and the difference between the current block timestamp and the proposal's end block is less than twice the timelock's grace period, it is in `Expired` state.

11. If none of the above conditions are met, return the `Succeeded` state.

Now, let's use this plan to check your implementation:

The function you wrote follows the plan outlined above. However, there are a couple of points that need to be addressed:

1. In the check for whether the proposal has been executed, you are checking the `timelock.getTimestamp(bytes32(proposalId))`, this is incorrect as the function `getTimestamp()` is not defined in the Timelock contract, and even if it was, it wouldn't be used to check if the proposal has been executed. You should directly check the `proposal.executed` variable.

2. In the check for `Expired` state, you are checking the `timelock.getTimestamp(bytes32(proposalId))` again, which as mentioned above, is incorrect.

3. Additionally, you are missing the check for `Succeeded` state.

Here's your corrected code:

```solidity
function state(uint proposalId) public view returns (ProposalState) {
    require(proposalCount >= proposalId && proposalId > 0, "GovernorBravo::state: invalid proposal id");
    Proposal memory proposal = proposals[proposalId];
    if (proposal.canceled) {
        return ProposalState.Canceled;
    } else if (block.number <= proposal.startBlock) {
        return ProposalState.Pending;
    } else if (block.number <= proposal.endBlock) {
        return ProposalState.Active;
    } else if (proposal.forVotes <= proposal.againstVotes || proposal.forVotes < quorumVotes) {
        return ProposalState.Defeated;
    } else if(proposal.executed) {
        return ProposalState.Executed;
    } else if (timelock.getPending(bytes32(proposalId)) > 0) {
        return ProposalState.Queued;
    } else if (timelock.getTimestamp(bytes32(proposalId)) > block.timestamp) {
        return ProposalState.Pending;
    } else if ((block.timestamp - proposal.endBlock) < 2 * timelock.GRACE_PERIOD()) {
        return ProposalState.Expired;
    } else {
        return ProposalState.Succeeded;
    }
}
```

Please note that it's assumed that you have a `proposalCount` variable that keeps track of the total number of proposals, a `proposals` mapping that maps an id to a `Proposal` struct, and a `timelock` object with `getPending()` and `GRACE_PERIOD()` functions.
