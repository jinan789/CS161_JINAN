TASK 1: Step-by-step plan to implement the 'mod' function

1. Start by defining the function with the name "mod". It should accept three parameters: two uint256 variables 'a' and 'b', and a string variable named 'errorMessage' in case the modulus operation isn't possible (e.g. if 'b' is 0).

2. Inside the function, check if 'b' is equal to 0. If it is, throw an error with the given 'errorMessage'.

3. If 'b' isn't 0, calculate the modulus (remainder) of 'a' divided by 'b' and store it in a uint256 variable.

4. Return the result of the modulus operation.

After analyzing your provided code (Information 3) and comparing it to the required functionalities (Information 2), I can say that your implementation does cover all the necessary steps. Your code looks correct and should function as expected:

```solidity
function mod(uint256 a, uint256 b, string memory errorMessage) internal pure returns (uint256) {
    require(b != 0, errorMessage);
    return a % b;
}
```

You can go ahead and add this function to the SafeMath library in your contract (Information 1).
