Function: mulExp
Input: Two Exp structs "a" and "b", each containing a uint mantissa.
Output: MathError and an Exp struct.

Summary: The function multiplies two given exponentials "a" and "b" and returns the product in a new Exp struct, taking care of accurate rounding instead of truncation. The MathError indicates any error that occurs during the process.
