FOUND: "Repeated Computations in a loop." The given Solidity code does not contain any loops. However, in case the function `_calcRateFromQty` is called multiple times within a loop in another contract, we can optimize it by storing the result of an expensive operation, i.e., the exponents calculation, into a function's argument instead of calculating it inside the function. This way, we would precompute the value outside the function and reuse it in subsequent function calls in the loop, saving gas.
