FOUND: Pattern 6 - Repeated computations in a loop. Description: The "approval" event is emitted in every iteration of the loop. But since the event contains the latest allowance value, emitting the event outside of the loop should suffice. Suggestion: Move the "emit Approval(src, msg.sender, allowances[src][msg.sender]);" line outside of the if statement. This will save gas as the event will only be emitted once, and the most up-to-date allowance is available.
