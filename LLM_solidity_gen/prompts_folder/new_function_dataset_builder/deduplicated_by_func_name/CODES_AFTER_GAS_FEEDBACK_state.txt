FOUND: "Opaque predicate." The following condition always evaluates to true: `proposalCount >= proposalId && proposalId > 0`. This is because `proposalId` is a `uint`, which is always non-negative, and it must be greater than 0 based on the requirement. Furthermore, `proposalCount` must be equal or greater than any valid `proposalId`. Therefore, the condition can be removed to save computations during runtime, and the corresponding error message can be removed as well.
