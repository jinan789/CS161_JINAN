The function that I want you to summarize is _setPendingImplementation(address newPendingImplementation, which is defined in the codes given below. Please note that I have hidden the definition of all other functions, but I still kept their signatureS, with the purpose of providing richer background information for you. The codes are: 
pragma solidity ^0.5.16;

import "./ErrorReporter.sol";
import "./ComptrollerStorage.sol";
/**
 * @title ComptrollerCore
 * @dev Storage for the comptroller is at this address, while execution is delegated to the `comptrollerImplementation`.
 * CTokens should reference this contract as their comptroller.
 */
contract Unitroller is UnitrollerAdminStorage, ComptrollerErrorReporter {

    /**
      * @notice Emitted when pendingComptrollerImplementation is changed
      */
    event NewPendingImplementation(address oldPendingImplementation, address newPendingImplementation);

    /**
      * @notice Emitted when pendingComptrollerImplementation is accepted, which means comptroller implementation is updated
      */
    event NewImplementation(address oldImplementation, address newImplementation);

    /**
      * @notice Emitted when pendingAdmin is changed
      */
    event NewPendingAdmin(address oldPendingAdmin, address newPendingAdmin);

    /**
      * @notice Emitted when pendingAdmin is accepted, which means admin is updated
      */
    event NewAdmin(address oldAdmin, address newAdmin);


    constructor() public {
    function _acceptImplementation() public returns (uint) {
    function _setPendingAdmin(address newPendingAdmin) public returns (uint) {
    function _acceptAdmin() public returns (uint) {
