FOUND: "Expensive operations in a loop." In the provided code, there is a loop that copies data from `returndata` to `result` using `mstore` and `mload`. However, this loop can be replaced with a built-in Solidity function `abi.encodePacked()` which can reduce gas usage by combining memory operations. Suggested fix: Replace the loop with a single call to the `abi.encodePacked()` function.
