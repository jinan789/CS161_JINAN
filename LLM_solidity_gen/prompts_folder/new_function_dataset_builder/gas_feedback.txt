I want you to help me find gas-wasting patterns from a given chunk of Solidity codes. You will need to match my codes against a list of known gas-wasting patterns, which will be given in a numbered list below. 

Before giving you the information, I want to tell you a high-level idea of gas optimization. Each instruction in the code sequence consumes a certain amount of gas based on their operation types, which costs money. If we could find an equivalent code instruction sequence that produces the same output while consuming less gas, then this would save money for Solidity users.

Now, the list of known gas-wasting patterns are given below. The list is numbered, with each bullet point specifying one gas-wasting pattern, which is followed by an explanation of why this pattern wastes gas. I want you to read through these and try to see if any gas-wasting patterns are found in the codes that I will give you later. The list is as follows:

1. "dead codes." Defined explicitly as codes that are guaranteed not to be executed during runtime. One example would be a conditional branch that would never be reached. 

2. "Opaque predicate." The outcome of an opaque predicate could be obviously inferred to be true or false without execution. As a result, the corresponding predicate check (e.g. if statement) could be removed to save computations during runtime. Note that the main idea of saving gas here is that simplifying the codes before deploying them does not cost gas, while if deployed codes have any inefficiency, then gas would be wasted due to runtime execution.

3. "Expensive operations in a loop." It refers to the pattern where expensive operations (in terms of gas consumption for Solidity smart contracts) are executed multiple times in a loop, but such expensive operations could be moved out of the loop such that they executed less number of times, without affecting the functionality of the codes. 

4. "Constant outcome of a loop." It refers to the pattern where the outcome of a loop may be a constant that can be inferred during compilation. Evaluating to this constant during runtime would cost gas and is therefore a waste of gas, since we could just replace it with the constant before deployment and save the gas used in the loop.

5. "Loop fusion." It refers to the pattern where there are several separate loops which could be combined into one, without changing the functionality. This has the benefit of reducing gas, in the sense that it can reduce the number of operations, such as conditional jumps and comparison, etc., at the entry points of loops. 

6. "Repeated computations in a loop." It refers to the pattern where there are expressions that produce the same outcome in each iteration of a loop. Hence, the gas can be saved by computing
the outcome once and then reusing the value instead of recomputing it in subsequent iterations, especially for expressions involving expensive operands. To save gas, this repeated computation could be done before the loop, and then the result could be reused within the loop.

7. "Comparison with unilateral outcome in a loop." It refers to the pattern where a comparison is executed in each iteration of a loop, but the result of the comparison is the same even if it cannot
be determined during compilation (e.g. a repeated comparison in the loop whose result depends on the runtime input). To save gas, this repeated comparison could be moved out of the loop, and then the result could be reused within the loop.

Next, I will give you a chunk of Solidity codes, and I want you to help me find gas-wasting patterns from it by matching against the above list of patterns. The codes are:
