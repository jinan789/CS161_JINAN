/**
 * @dev An upgradeability mechanism designed for UUPS proxies. The functions included here can perform an upgrade of an
 * {ERC1967Proxy}, when this contract is set as the implementation behind such a proxy.
 *
 * A security mechanism ensures that an upgrade does not turn off upgradeability accidentally, although this risk is
 * reinstated if the upgrade retains upgradeability but removes the security mechanism, e.g. by replacing
 * `UUPSUpgradeable` with a custom implementation of upgrades.
 *
 * The {_authorizeUpgrade} function must be overridden to include access restriction to the upgrade mechanism.
 *
 * _Available since v4.1._
