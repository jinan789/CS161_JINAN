TASK 1: After analyzing your code, I have noticed the following problems:

1. The code structure does not follow the memory-safe assembly usage, just like in the given two few-shot examples.
2. The code uses require statements to validate input, which is not consistent with the given examples.

TASK 2: Based on the suggestions from TASK 1, here is the modified function code:

<CODE_BEGINNING>
function safeApprove(
    ERC20 token,
    address to,
    uint256 amount
) internal {
    bool success;

    //MODIFICATIONS MADE: Implementing memory-safe assembly like in the few-shot examples
    /// @solidity memory-safe-assembly
    assembly {
        // Get a pointer to some free memory.
        let freeMemoryPointer := mload(0x40)

        // Write the ABI-encoded calldata into memory, beginning with the function selector.
        mstore(freeMemoryPointer, 0x095ea7b300000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000)
        mstore(add(freeMemoryPointer, 4), to) // Append the "to" argument.
        mstore(add(freeMemoryPointer, 36), amount) // Append the "amount" argument.

        //MODIFICATIONS MADE: Making the call similar to the given examples
        success := and(
            // Set success to whether the call reverted; if not, we check it either
            // returned exactly 1 (can't just be non-zero data), or had no return data.
            or(and(eq(mload(0), 1), gt(returndatasize(), 31)), iszero(returndatasize())),
            // We use 68 because the length of our calldata totals up like so: 4 + 32 * 2.
            // We use 0 and 32 to copy up to 32 bytes of return data into the scratch space.
            // Counterintuitively, this call must be positioned second to the or() call in the
            // surrounding and() call, or else returndatasize() will be zero during the computation.
            call(gas(), token, 0, freeMemoryPointer, 68, 0, 32)
        )
    }

    //MODIFICATIONS MADE: Replacing the revert statement with require for consistency with the few-shot examples
    require(success, "APPROVE_FAILED");
}
