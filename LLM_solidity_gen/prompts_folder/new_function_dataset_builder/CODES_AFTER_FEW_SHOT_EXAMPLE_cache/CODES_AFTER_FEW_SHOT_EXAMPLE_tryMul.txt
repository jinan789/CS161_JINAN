TASK 1:
1. There is a potential issue with the overflow check, as you are using combined checks in an `if` statement within the `tryMul()` function. This method does not follow the style used by other functions within the SafeMath library.
2. The `unchecked` block is missing in your `tryMul()` function. It should be added to prevent unnecessary overflow checks.

TASK 2:
<CODE_BEGINNING>
    function tryMul(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (bool success, uint256 result) {
        if (a == 0 || b == 0) {
            return (true, 0);
        }
        
        // MODIFICATIONS MADE: We add an `unchecked` block to prevent unnecessary overflow checks and follow the standard style employed within the SafeMath library.
        unchecked {
            uint256 c = a * b;
            
            // MODIFICATIONS MADE: Refactor the condition for success to follow the style used in the `tryAdd()` function.
            if (c / a != b) {
                return (false, 0);
            }
            
            return (true, c);
        }
    }
