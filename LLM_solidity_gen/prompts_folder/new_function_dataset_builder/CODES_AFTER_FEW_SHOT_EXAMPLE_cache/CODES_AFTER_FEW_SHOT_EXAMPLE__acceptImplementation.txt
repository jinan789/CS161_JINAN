TASK 1:
1. Your code looks correct and it follows the same style as the given examples. It is neatly organized and makes use of appropriate checks for the pendingComptrollerImplementation.

TASK 2:
Since your code is already correct, no modifications are needed. However, I'll add the <CODE_BEGINNING> and <CODE_ENDING> tokens as requested.

<CODE_BEGINNING>
function _acceptImplementation() public returns (uint) {
    // Check that the caller is the pending implementation and not the zero address
    if (msg.sender != pendingComptrollerImplementation || pendingComptrollerImplementation == address(0)) {
        return fail(Error.UNAUTHORIZED, FailureInfo.ACCEPT_PENDING_IMPLEMENTATION_ADDRESS_CHECK);
    }

    // Update the current comptroller implementation
    address oldImplementation = comptrollerImplementation;
    comptrollerImplementation = pendingComptrollerImplementation;

    // Clear the pending implementation
    pendingComptrollerImplementation = address(0);

    // Emit the NewImplementation event
    emit NewImplementation(oldImplementation, comptrollerImplementation);

    return uint(Error.NO_ERROR);
}
<CODE_ENDING>
