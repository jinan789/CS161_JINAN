TASK 1:
1. The code seems to correctly implement the binary search algorithm and follows the few-shot examples in terms of structure and logic.
2. No major issues or incorrect or inappropriate usage of contextual functions or contracts were detected.

TASK 2:
As mentioned in TASK 1, there were no major issues with your code, so no modifications are needed. However, I will still provide the same code with the <CODE_BEGINNING> and <CODE_ENDING> tokens as you requested.

<CODE_BEGINNING>
function getPriorVotes(address account, uint blockNumber) public view returns (uint96) {
    require(blockNumber < block.number, "INV: blockNumber must be in the past");

    // Most recent balance (last checkpoint)
    uint32 nCheckpoints = numCheckpoints[account];
    if (nCheckpoints == 0) {
        return 0;
    }

    // Implicit zero balance (no checkpoint)
    Checkpoint memory cp = checkpoints[account][nCheckpoints - 1];
    if (cp.fromBlock <= blockNumber) {
        return cp.votes;
    }

    // Perform binary search for the vote count at the specified block number
    uint32 min = 0;
    uint32 max = nCheckpoints - 1;
    while (min < max) {
        uint32 mid = (min + max + 1) / 2;
        cp = checkpoints[account][mid];
        if (cp.fromBlock <= blockNumber) {
            min = mid;
        } else {
            max = mid - 1;
        }
    }
    cp = checkpoints[account][min];

    return cp.fromBlock <= blockNumber ? cp.votes : 0;
}
<CODE_ENDING>
