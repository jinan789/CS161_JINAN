TASK 1:

1. The function should be marked as `internal` instead of `public` since it's intended to be used only by functions within `GovernorBravoDelegate` contract. 
2. In the require statement for validating if the sender is not a whitelisted voter, you should use the parameter `voter` instead of `msg.sender`. 

TASK 2:

<CODE_BEGINNING>
//MODIFICATIONS MADE: Changed the function visibility to internal
function castVoteInternal(address voter, uint proposalId, uint8 support) internal returns (uint256) {
    require(state(proposalId) == ProposalState.Active, "GovernorBravo::_castVoteInternal: voting is closed");
    require(support <= 2, "GovernorBravo::_castVoteInternal: invalid voting option");
    //MODIFICATIONS MADE: Replaced msg.sender with voter
    require(!isWhitelisted(voter),"GovernorBravo::_castVoteInternal: Top stakers cannot cast vote");

    Proposal storage proposal = proposals[proposalId];
    Receipt storage receipt = proposal.receipts[voter];
    require(receipt.hasVoted == false, "GovernorBravo::_castVoteInternal: voter already voted");

    uint96 votes = getPriorVotes(voter, proposal.startBlock);

    if (support == 0) {
        proposal.againstVotes = add256(proposal.againstVotes, votes);
    } else if (support == 1) {
        proposal.forVotes = add256(proposal.forVotes, votes);
    } else if (support == 2) {
        proposal.abstainVotes = add256(proposal.abstainVotes, votes);
    }

    receipt.hasVoted = true;
    receipt.support = support;
    receipt.votes = votes;

    emit VoteCast(voter, proposalId, support, votes, "");

    return votes;
