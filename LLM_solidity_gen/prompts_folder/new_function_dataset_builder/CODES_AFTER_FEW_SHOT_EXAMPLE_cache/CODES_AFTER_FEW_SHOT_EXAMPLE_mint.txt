TASK 1:
1. You should use SafeMath for arithmetic operations instead of direct addition or subtraction.
2. In the "_moveDelegates" function call, you should cast rawAmount to uint96 using "safe96" before passing it.

TASK 2:
<CODE_BEGINNING>
function mint(address dst, uint rawAmount) external onlyOwner {
    require(dst != address(0), "INV: cannot mint tokens to the zero address");

    // Update total supply of tokens
    totalSupply = SafeMath.add(totalSupply, rawAmount);

    // Transfer the newly minted tokens to the specified address
    uint96 mintAmount = safe96(rawAmount, "INV: transfer amount overflows"); //MODIFICATIONS MADE: Introduced new variable mintAmount since it is used multiple times in the function
    balances[dst] = add96(balances[dst], mintAmount, "INV: transfer amount overflows");

    // Update the delegates of the recipient address
    _moveDelegates(address(0), delegates[dst], mintAmount); //MODIFICATIONS MADE: Replaced rawAmount with mintAmount (Already cast to uint96) to avoid repetitive casting

    // Emit the transfer event
    emit Transfer(address(0), dst, rawAmount);
}
