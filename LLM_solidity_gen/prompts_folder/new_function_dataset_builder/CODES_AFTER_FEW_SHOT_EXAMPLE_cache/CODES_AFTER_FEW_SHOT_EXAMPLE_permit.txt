TASK 1: Based on the given few-shot examples, I found the following issues:

1. In this line of code: `uint96 amount = safe96(rawAmount, "INV: amount exceeds 96 bits");`, it's possible that rawAmount may be equal to `uint(-1)`, in which case `amount` should be set to `uint96(-1)` according to the approve() function code.

2. The function doesn't have any constraints on the number of increases allowed for `nonces[_owner]`. It looks like `nonces[_owner]++` should be moved below the `require` statements to make sure that the nonce is only incremented after all checks have passed successfully.

TASK 2: Here's the modified function code with corrections:

<CODE_BEGINNING>
function permit(address _owner, address spender, uint rawAmount, uint deadline, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) external {
    require(deadline >= block.timestamp, "INV: permit expired");
    
    //MODIFICATIONS MADE: Check if rawAmount is equal to uint(-1)
    uint96 amount;
    if (rawAmount == uint(-1)) {
        amount = uint96(-1);
    } else {
        amount = safe96(rawAmount, "INV: amount exceeds 96 bits");
    }
    
    bytes32 domainSeparator = keccak256(abi.encode(DOMAIN_TYPEHASH, keccak256(bytes(name)), getChainId(), address(this)));
    bytes32 structHash = keccak256(abi.encode(PERMIT_TYPEHASH, _owner, spender, rawAmount, nonces[_owner], deadline)); //MODIFICATIONS MADE: Use nonces[_owner] without incrementing here
    bytes32 digest = keccak256(abi.encodePacked("\x19\x01", domainSeparator, structHash));
    address recoveredAddress = ecrecover(digest, v, r, s);
    require(recoveredAddress != address(0) && recoveredAddress == _owner, "INV: invalid signature");
    
    //MODIFICATIONS MADE: Increment nonces[_owner] after all checks have passed
    nonces[_owner]++;

    allowances[_owner][spender] = amount;
    emit Approval(_owner, spender, amount);
}
