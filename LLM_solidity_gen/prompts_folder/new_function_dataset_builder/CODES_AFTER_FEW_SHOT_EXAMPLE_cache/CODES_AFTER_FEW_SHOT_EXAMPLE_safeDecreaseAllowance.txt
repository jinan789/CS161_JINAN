TASK 1:
1. Your implementation of the `safeDecreaseAllowance` function seems to be correct and consistent with the behavior of the other functions provided in the SafeERC20 library. There is no misuse of the contextual functions or contracts detected.

TASK 2:
Since there is no need for modifications, the code remains the same:

<CODE_BEGINNING>
function safeDecreaseAllowance(
    IERC20 token,
    address spender,
    uint256 value
) internal {
    uint256 currentAllowance = token.allowance(address(this), spender);
    require(currentAllowance >= value, "SafeERC20: decreased allowance below zero");
    uint256 newAllowance = currentAllowance - value;
    _callOptionalReturn(token, abi.encodeWithSelector(token.approve.selector, spender, newAllowance));
}
<CODE_ENDING>
