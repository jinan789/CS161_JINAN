TASK 1:
1. You are missing the NonReentrant modifier, which is used in other functions to prevent reentrancy attacks.
2. `doTransferIn` is undefined in the provided contract snippet. Depending on its implementation, there might be an issue with environment assignment or implementation of the function.

TASK 2:
<CODE_BEGINNING>
function _addReservesFresh(uint addAmount) internal nonReentrant returns (uint, uint) { // MODIFICATIONS MADE: Added nonReentrant modifier to prevent reentrancy attacks
    // Check for fresh block number
    if (accrualBlockNumber != getBlockNumber()) {
        return (uint(Error.NOT_FRESH), 0);
    }

    // Transfer tokens from msg.sender to the contract
    uint actualAddAmount = doTransferIn(msg.sender, addAmount); // MODIFICATIONS MADE: Implementation of doTransferIn is not given in the provided context, depending on its implementation this line might have issues.

    // Increase total reserves by the actual transferred amount
    totalReserves = add_(totalReserves, actualAddAmount);

    // Emit the ReservesAdded event
    emit ReservesAdded(msg.sender, addAmount, actualAddAmount);

    return (uint(Error.NO_ERROR), actualAddAmount);
