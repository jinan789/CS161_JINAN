<CODE_BEGINNING>
function approve(address spender, uint rawAmount) public returns (bool) {
    require(spender != address(0), "INV: approve to the zero address");
    uint96 amount = safe96(rawAmount, "INV: amount exceeds 96 bits");
    allowances[msg.sender][spender] = amount;

    emit Approval(msg.sender, spender, rawAmount);

    return true;
}
