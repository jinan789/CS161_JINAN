TASK 1:
1. The function name should follow the same naming pattern as the other functions in the SafeMath library, i.e., it should be `mod` instead of `modWithError`.
2. There is no need to check if `b != 0` in this function, as it is already handled in the `tryMod` function.

TASK 2:
<CODE_BEGINNING>
//MODIFICATIONS MADE: Changed function name to mod and removed unnecessary require statement
function mod(uint256 a, uint256 b, string memory errorMessage) internal pure returns (uint256) {
    return a % b;
}
<CODE_ENDING>
