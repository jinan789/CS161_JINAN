TASK 1:
1. The function "functionCallWithValue" doesn't have any major issues as such and is well-written.
2. The commented out section is correct because the 'call' function does check for balance automatically.

TASK 2: As there is no major issues with the code to correct, the function "functionCallWithValue" remains unchanged.

<CODE_BEGINNING>
function functionCallWithValue(
    address target,
    bytes memory data,
    uint256 value,
    string memory errorMessage
) internal returns (bytes memory) {
    // Removed this section as the Solidity 'call' function will check the balance automatically
    //require(
    //    address(this).balance >= value,
    //    "Address: insufficient balance for call"
    //);

    require(
        isContract(target),
        "Address: target is not a contract"
    );

    (bool success, bytes memory returndata) = target.call{value: value}(data);
    return verifyCallResult(success, returndata, errorMessage);
}
