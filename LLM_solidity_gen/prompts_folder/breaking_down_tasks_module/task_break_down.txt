I want to write some Solidity codes and I want you to act as a software engineering designer and tell me how to break down the task by functionality. More specifically, please help break down the task into different functions, and give me a list of the functions to be generated in the form of bullet points, where each bullet point is a function with the following information:

1. Function signature
2. The input and output format of the function
3. An overall description of the functionalities of the function, which should be informative enough for an GPT-4 agent to understand and generate the corresponding codes

Here is an example of how your output format should be:

<FUNCTION_SIGNATURE_START>
The function signature should be put here
<FUNCTION_SIGNATURE_END>

<INPUT_OUTPUT_START>
The input and output format should be put here
<INPUT_OUTPUT_END>

<FUNCTIONS_DESCRIPTION_START>
1. The description of the first function should be put here
2. The description of the second function should be put here
3. ...
<FUNCTIONS_DESCRIPTION_END>

Here is the task we are trying to accomplish:
