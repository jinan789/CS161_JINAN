The redeem function in the Solidity contract takes one input variable:
- `redeemTokens`: a uint which represents the amount of tokens to redeem.

The function returns a `uint`, which represents the status code of the redemption operation. The redeem function is used to redeem the specified number of tokens from the contract. It only describes the most essential functionality, allowing the user to exchange tokens for underlying assets.
