The function that I want you to summarize is _msgData, which is defined in the codes given below. Please note that I have hidden the definition of all other functions, but I still kept their signature, with the purpose of providing richer background information for you. The codes are: 
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

/**
 * @dev Provides information about the current execution context, including the
 * sender of the transaction and its data. While these are generally available
 * via msg.sender and msg.data, they should not be accessed in such a direct
 * manner, since when dealing with meta-transactions the account sending and
 * paying for execution may not be the actual sender (as far as an application
 * is concerned).
 *
 * This contract is only required for intermediate, library-like contracts.

abstract contract Context {
    function _msgSender() internal view virtual returns (address) {
    function _msgData() internal view virtual returns (bytes calldata) {
        return msg.data;
    }

}
