Function name: `divScalarByExpTruncate`

Input: two variables
1. An unsigned integer variable `scalar`
2. A struct variable of type `Exp` named `divisor`

Output: returns a tuple with
1. A MathError enum value
2. An unsigned integer

Summary: The function takes a scalar value as input and divides it by another input of type Exp. After the division, the resulting value is truncated and returned along with any MathError, if encountered.
