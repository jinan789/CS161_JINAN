The function that I want you to summarize is getSupplyRate, which is defined in the codes given below. Please note that I have hidden the definition of all other functions, but I still kept their signature, with the purpose of providing richer background information for you. The codes are: 
pragma solidity ^0.5.16;

/**
  * @title Compound's InterestRateModel Interface
  * @author Compound
  */
contract InterestRateModel {
    /// @notice Indicator that this is an InterestRateModel contract (for inspection)
    bool public constant isInterestRateModel = true;

    /**
      * @notice Calculates the current borrow interest rate per block
      * @param cash The total amount of cash the market has
      * @param borrows The total amount of borrows the market has outstanding
      * @param reserves The total amount of reserves the market has
      * @return The borrow rate per block (as a percentage, and scaled by 1e18)
      */
    function getBorrowRate(uint cash, uint borrows, uint reserves) external view returns (uint);
    function getSupplyRate(uint cash, uint borrows, uint reserves, uint reserveFactorMantissa) external view returns (uint);

}
}
