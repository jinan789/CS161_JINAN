The function that I want you to summarize is getUnderlyingPrice, which is defined in the codes given below. Please note that I have hidden the definition of all other functions, but I still kept their signature, with the purpose of providing richer background information for you. The codes are: 
pragma solidity ^0.5.16;

import "./CToken.sol";

contract PriceOracle {
    /// @notice Indicator that this is a PriceOracle contract (for inspection)
    bool public constant isPriceOracle = true;

    /**
      * @notice Get the underlying price of a cToken asset
      * @param cToken The cToken to get the underlying price of
      * @return The underlying asset price mantissa (scaled by 1e18).
      *  Zero means the price is unavailable.
      */
    function getUnderlyingPrice(CToken cToken) external view returns (uint);
}
}
