The function that I want you to summarize is toUint160, which is defined in the codes given below. Please note that I have hidden the definition of all other functions, but I still kept their signature, with the purpose of providing richer background information for you. The codes are: 
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.17;

library SafeCast160 {
    /// @notice Thrown when a valude greater than type(uint160).max is cast to uint160
    error UnsafeCast();

    /// @notice Safely casts uint256 to uint160
    /// @param value The uint256 to be cast
    function toUint160(uint256 value) internal pure returns (uint160) {
        if (value > type(uint160).max) revert UnsafeCast();
        return uint160(value);
    }
}
}
