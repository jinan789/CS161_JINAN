The function that I want you to summarize is sendValue, which is defined in the codes given below. Please note that I have hidden the definition of all other functions, but I still kept their signature, with the purpose of providing richer background information for you. The codes are:

     *  - an address where a contract will be created

     * plain `call` is an unsafe replacement for a function call: use this

     * function (like regular Solidity function calls).

     * - `target` must be a contract.
