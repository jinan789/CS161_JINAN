The function that I want you to summarize is allowance, which is defined in the codes given below. Please note that I have hidden the definition of all other functions, but I still kept their signature, with the purpose of providing richer background information for you. The codes are: 
pragma solidity ^0.5.16;

/**
 * @title EIP20NonStandardInterface
 * @dev Version of ERC20 with no return values for `transfer` and `transferFrom`
 *  See https://medium.com/coinmonks/missing-return-value-bug-at-least-130-tokens-affected-d67bf08521ca
 */
interface EIP20NonStandardInterface {

    /**
     * @notice Get the total number of tokens in circulation
     * @return The supply of tokens
     */
    function totalSupply() external view returns (uint256);
    function balanceOf(address owner) external view returns (uint256 balance);
    function transfer(address dst, uint256 amount) external;
    function transferFrom(address src, address dst, uint256 amount) external;
    function approve(address spender, uint256 amount) external returns (bool success);
    function allowance(address owner, address spender) external view returns (uint256 remaining);

    event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 amount);
    event Approval(address indexed owner, address indexed spender, uint256 amount);
}
}
