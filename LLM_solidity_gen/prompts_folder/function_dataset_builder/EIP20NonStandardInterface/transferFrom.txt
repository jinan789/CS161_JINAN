The function that I want you to summarize is transferFrom, which is defined in the codes given below. Please note that I have hidden the definition of all other functions, but I still kept their signature, with the purpose of providing richer background information for you. The codes are: 
pragma solidity ^0.5.16;

/**
 * @title EIP20NonStandardInterface
 * @dev Version of ERC20 with no return values for `transfer` and `transferFrom`
 *  See https://medium.com/coinmonks/missing-return-value-bug-at-least-130-tokens-affected-d67bf08521ca
 */
interface EIP20NonStandardInterface {

    /**
     * @notice Get the total number of tokens in circulation
     * @return The supply of tokens
     */
    function totalSupply() external view returns (uint256);
    function balanceOf(address owner) external view returns (uint256 balance);
    function transfer(address dst, uint256 amount) external;
    function transferFrom(address src, address dst, uint256 amount) external;

    /**
      * @notice Approve `spender` to transfer up to `amount` from `src`
      * @dev This will overwrite the approval amount for `spender`
      *  and is subject to issues noted [here](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20#approve)
      * @param spender The address of the account which may transfer tokens
      * @param amount The number of tokens that are approved
      * @return Whether or not the approval succeeded
      */
    function approve(address spender, uint256 amount) external returns (bool success);
    function allowance(address owner, address spender) external view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
