To add the `getCash` function as described in the summary, you can simply add the following code snippet to your `CToken` contract:

```solidity
/**
 * @notice Returns the amount of cash available in the contract
 * @return The cash amount returned by getCashPrior()
 */
function getCash() public view returns (uint) {
    return getCashPrior();
}
```

This function is marked as `public view` since it only reads data from the contract state and doesn't modify anything. It directly calls the `getCashPrior()` function and returns its value, fulfilling the given requirements of the function summary.
