The function you want summarized is _acceptAdmin:

Input: No explicit input parameters, but uses msg.sender as the caller.
Output: A single uint representing error codes (Error.NO_ERROR = 0 if successful)

Summary: This function allows a pending admin to accept the admin role by ensuring the caller is a valid pending admin and then updating the admin and pendingAdmin state variables. It also emits NewAdmin and NewPendingAdmin events to log these changes.
