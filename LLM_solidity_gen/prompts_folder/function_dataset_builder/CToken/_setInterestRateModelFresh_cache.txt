Input: 
1. newInterestRateModel (type: InterestRateModel)

Output: 
1. uint (Error code)

Summary: 
The function _setInterestRateModelFresh updates the interest rate model of the CToken contract. It requires the caller to be the admin and the contract to be in a fresh state (accrual block number is equal to the current block number). The new interest rate model must also pass the isInterestRateModel() check. On success, the function emits a NewMarketInterestRateModel event with the old and new interest rate models and returns the error code for no error.
