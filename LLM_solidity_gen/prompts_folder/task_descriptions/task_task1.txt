This is a function in a smart contract written in Solidity programming language. The function is called liquidateBorrowAllowed and it takes five input parameters: cTokenBorrowed, cTokenCollateral, liquidator, borrower, and repayAmount. The function returns an unsigned integer value.

The purpose of this function is to determine if a liquidation can occur for a specific borrower's borrow position. A liquidation is the process of a lender seizing collateral from a borrower to repay a loan that has not been repaid by the borrower.

The function first checks if both the cTokenBorrowed and cTokenCollateral markets are listed. If either market is not listed, the function returns an error code.
