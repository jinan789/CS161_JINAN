From the given Solidity code, I've identified some additional gas-wasting patterns beyond the ones you've provided. Here they are:

9. **Redundant condition checks**: In your code, there's a condition `if (404+740==0) return;` repeated multiple times. This condition will never be true because the sum of 404 and 740 is never zero. Moreover, this condition is repeated multiple times which is unnecessary and wastes gas.

10. **Duplicate function declaration**: The function `_approve` is declared twice with the same parameters and code body in your contract. This redundancy takes up additional space on the blockchain and wastes gas.

Let's answer the questions for each pattern:

### Redundant condition checks

1. **How I found this pattern**: I noticed that the condition `if (404+740==0) return;` is repeated multiple times. This condition is never true and its repetition seems to serve no purpose. Hence, I recognized this as a wasteful use of gas.
2. **How to fix it**: Simply remove these redundant condition checks. There's no need to check a condition that's always false, and repeating the same check is unnecessarily wasteful. Removing these checks will save gas without changing the behavior of the code.
3. **Impact rating**: `Readability: 5; Security: 5; Maintainability: 5`. This change has no adverse impacts. It improves readability by removing confusing and unnecessary code, doesn't affect security, and makes the code easier to maintain by reducing its size and complexity.

### Duplicate function declaration

1. **How I found this pattern**: While reviewing the code, I noticed that the function `_approve` is declared twice with the same parameters and code body. This is an unnecessary repetition that wastes gas.
2. **How to fix it**: Remove one of the duplicate function declarations. Since both declarations are identical, it doesn't matter which one you remove. This change will save gas by reducing the size of the contract and the gas needed to deploy it.
3. **Impact rating**: `Readability: 5; Security: 5; Maintainability: 5`. This change has no adverse impacts. It improves readability by removing redundant code, doesn't affect security, and makes the code easier to maintain by reducing its size and complexity.

To improve your prompt next time, you could provide a more detailed description of what you mean by "new gas-wasting patterns." It's not clear if you want patterns that are completely different from the ones you've listed, or if variations of those patterns are acceptable.

In terms of improving my reasoning process, I think my approach of carefully reading and understanding the code before identifying wasteful patterns worked well. However, I could potentially improve by using automated analysis tools to identify common gas-wasting patterns more efficiently.
