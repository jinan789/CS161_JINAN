Here are some new gas-wasting patterns discovered from the provided code, each with detailed explanations and steps to fix them.

1. **Unnecessary Condition Checking**: The contract contains multiple instances of `if (some_constant==0) return;` where `some_constant` is a constant number. These operations are unnecessary and consume additional gas.

    **How did you find this pattern?**
    This pattern was found by reading through the code and noticing the repeated pattern of `if(some_constant==0) return;`. Since the condition is never true, the operation is unnecessary and wasteful.

    **What should I do to fix the found gas-wasting patterns?**
    To fix this pattern, simply remove these unnecessary condition checks. This will save the gas used to execute these operations.

    **Readability: 5; Security: 5; Maintainability: 5**

2. **Repeated Function Definition**: The function `_approve` is defined twice in the contract with the same parameters and functionality. This is wasteful in terms of gas usage.

    **How did you find this pattern?**
    This pattern was found by scanning through the code and noticing that the function `_approve` was defined twice, with identical parameters and functionality.

    **What should I do to fix the found gas-wasting patterns?**
    To fix this pattern, remove the second definition of the function `_approve`. This will save the gas used to deploy the redundant function code.

    **Readability: 5; Security: 5; Maintainability: 5**

3. **Unnecessary Type Casting**: The contract contains unnecessary type castings, such as `uint256(bytes32(_balances[account]))`. This is wasteful in terms of gas usage.

    **How did you find this pattern?**
    This pattern was found by inspecting the code and noticing the unnecessary type casting. If the `_balances` mapping is already storing `uint256` types, there is no need to cast it as `bytes32` and back to `uint256`.

    **What should I do to fix the found gas-wasting patterns?**
    To fix this pattern, remove the unnecessary type castings. This will save the gas used to perform these operations.

    **Readability: 5; Security: 5; Maintainability: 5**

Regarding your additional requirements:

1.  The prompt was clear and provided sufficient information to perform the task. However, it would be beneficial to provide a little more context about the specific contract functionality. This might help in identifying more sophisticated gas-wasting patterns that are related to contract logic rather than just the code structure.

2.  The reasoning process involved first understanding the provided gas-wasting patterns, then reading through the provided code multiple times. Each read-through focused on a different aspect: function definitions, condition checks, type castings, etc. The process could be improved by creating a checklist of common wasteful patterns and systematically checking the code against each item on the list. This would ensure a thorough and organized approach. In this instance, no issues were found with the output.
