After examining the Solidity code, I found two new potential gas-wasting patterns:

1. **Redundant Conditional Checks**
    - **How did you find this pattern?** In the `umbrella` function, there are multiple instances of `if (240==0) return;`. This statement is always false and the condition check is unnecessary, wasting gas.
    - **What should I do to fix this?** You should remove these redundant conditional checks. They do not contribute to the program's execution as they will always evaluate to false. 
    - **Impact on readability, security, and maintainability:** 
        - Readability: 5; this change will not affect the readability of your code.
        - Security: 5; it will not affect the security of your code.
        - Maintainability: 5; it will not affect the maintainability of your code.

2. **Duplicate Function Definitions**
    - **How did you find this pattern?** In the Solidity code, the `_approve` function is defined twice with the same parameters and the same implementation. This is not only gas-inefficient but also leads to ambiguity and potential bugs in the code.
    - **What should I do to fix this?** Remove one of the duplicate function definitions to save gas and also to make the code cleaner and less prone to bugs.
    - **Impact on readability, security, and maintainability:** 
        - Readability: 5; removing duplicate code tends to improve code readability.
        - Security: 5; this will not affect the security of your code.
        - Maintainability: 5; eliminating duplicate code makes your program easier to maintain.

Regarding the additional requirements:

1. Your prompt was clear and well-informed. However, providing a brief explanation of the existing gas-wasting patterns could be beneficial for those who are not familiar with them.
2. The reasoning process was straightforward, as the patterns were relatively easy to identify. However, to enhance the efficiency of finding gas-wasting patterns, it could be helpful to use tools designed for Solidity static analysis and gas estimation. For instance, using a tool like Mythril or Slither could automate some of the gas-wasting pattern detection.
