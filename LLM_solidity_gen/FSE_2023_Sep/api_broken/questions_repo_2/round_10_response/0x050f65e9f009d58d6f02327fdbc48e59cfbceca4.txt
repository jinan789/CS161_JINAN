Sure, I have found a few potential gas-wasting patterns in the provided Solidity code. Please note that these patterns are not necessarily always gas-wasting, but in some cases, they could lead to inefficiencies. Here are my findings:

## Pattern 1: Inefficient use of SafeMath

SafeMath has been used in the code for mathematical operations to prevent overflows. However, since Solidity 0.8.0, the compiler automatically checks for underflow and overflow. So, using SafeMath library is not necessary and it could consume extra gas.

1. **Finding process**: I scanned the code for places where arithmetic operations were performed. I noticed that SafeMath functions (`*`, `-`, etc.) were used, which could consume extra gas.
2. **Fix**: Replace SafeMath operations with regular mathematical operations. For instance, replace `x.mul(y)` with `x * y`.
3. **Impact**: Readability: 5; Security: 5; Maintainability: 5. This change does not affect readability, security, or maintainability.

## Pattern 2: Repeated use of the `safeTransfer` function

The function `safeTransfer` from the ERC20 standard is used multiple times. Each call to `safeTransfer` uses gas. If multiple transfers are going to the same address, it might be more gas efficient to accumulate the total amount first and then do a single transfer.

1. **Finding process**: I looked for repeated function calls in the code. Specifically, I noticed that `safeTransfer` was used multiple times in the code.
2. **Fix**: Accumulate the total amount to be transferred to the same address, and then make a single call to `safeTransfer`. For instance, instead of making two calls to `safeTransfer`, accumulate the total and make one call.
3. **Impact**: Readability: 4; Security: 5; Maintainability: 4. While this could slightly reduce readability (since we need to keep track of the total amount to be transferred), it does not impact security and only slightly impacts maintainability.

## Pattern 3: Unnecessary function calls

The function `totalMatchAmount()` is called multiple times in the `completeSwap` function. This could be inefficient if `totalMatchAmount()` has a nontrivial gas cost.

1. **Finding process**: I noticed that `totalMatchAmount()` was called multiple times in `completeSwap`.
2. **Fix**: Store the result of `totalMatchAmount()` in a local variable and reuse it.
3. **Impact**: Readability: 5; Security: 5; Maintainability: 5. This change does not affect readability, security, or maintainability.

To improve the prompt next time, it would be helpful to include more context about the contract, such as the definition and implementation of functions like `totalMatchAmount()` and `commitment.getAmountSplit()`. This would allow for a more in-depth analysis of potential gas-inefficiencies.

For better reasoning in the future, it's important to keep in mind the specific peculiarities of the Ethereum Virtual Machine and Solidity, such as the cost of storage compared to memory and the cost of SSTORE operations. Also, consider the trade-offs between gas optimization and code readability and maintainability.
