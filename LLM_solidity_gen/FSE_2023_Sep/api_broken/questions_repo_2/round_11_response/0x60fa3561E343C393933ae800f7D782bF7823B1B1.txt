After reviewing your Solidity script, I found the following new gas-wasting patterns:

1. Duplicate checks for conditions: At several points in your code, you're repeating checks for the same conditions. For example, in both `createTerm` and `topupReward` functions, you're checking if the `_depositWindow` is 0, even though this could be checked once and stored. As a result, you're wasting gas by repeating the same checks.

   - Discovery: I noticed this pattern when I saw the same conditions being checked in different functions. Gas costs are an important consideration in Solidity, so repeated checks stood out as potential inefficiencies.
   
   - Fix: A solution would be to store the result of the check once and subsequently use this stored value. This would eliminate the need for repeated checks and save gas.
   
   - Impact: Readability: 5; Security: 5; Maintainability: 4. There's no significant impact on readability and security, but potentially a slight impact on maintainability, as you need to ensure the stored value is updated correctly.

2. Overuse of the `nonReentrant` modifier: While `nonReentrant` is a useful security measure, it also increases gas costs. In your code, it's used in nearly every function, which might be overkill and result in unnecessarily high gas costs.
   
   - Discovery: This pattern was noticed when I saw the `nonReentrant` modifier being used repeatedly. While it's important to prevent reentrancy attacks, its overuse seemed like a potential gas inefficiency.
   
   - Fix: Evaluate each function and consider if the usage of `nonReentrant` is absolutely necessary. For those functions where it is not, remove the `nonReentrant` modifier to save on gas costs.
   
   - Impact: Readability: 5; Security: 3; Maintainability: 5. The fix does not affect readability or maintainability, but could potentially impact security if `nonReentrant` is removed from a function where it's needed.

3. Inefficient use of storage: The `Term` struct is stored in an array `terms[]`, and you're accessing it multiple times within the same function (`unlock` and `lock` functions for example). Each time you access `term`, it's a read operation from storage, which is much more expensive than memory.

   - Discovery: I noticed the `Term` struct being accessed multiple times within the same function, which, knowing that storage is more expensive than memory in Solidity, hinted at a potential gas inefficiency.
   
   - Fix: You could reduce gas costs by reading the `Term` struct once into memory at the beginning of the function, operate on the memory copy, and then write back to storage once at the end, if necessary.
   
   - Impact: Readability: 5; Security: 5; Maintainability: 4. This change would not have a significant impact on readability or security, but there might be a slight impact on maintainability, as you need to make sure any changes to the memory copy are written back to storage.

To improve the prompt, it would be helpful to have some specific constraints or goals, such as a target gas cost or specific functions to optimize. This would provide more context and allow for more targeted solutions.

In terms of refining my reasoning process, I believe that understanding the context in which the code is used would be beneficial. This would involve understanding the business requirements and constraints, which would help to identify potential optimizations. Additionally, having a deep understanding of Solidity and its gas costs would also be beneficial in quickly identifying potential inefficiencies.
