Based on the provided Solidity code, one potential gas-optimization pattern that can be observed is:

1. **Repeated encoding and decoding of variables:** The practice of frequent encoding and decoding of variables can be inefficient and costly in terms of gas. For instance, in the `payParams` function, metadata is decoded two times: once to check if the quote is valid and another time to get the quote and slippage. This is unnecessary and wastes computational resources.

Here are the answers to your questions:

1. **How did you find this pattern?** This pattern was found by closely examining the code and noticing the repeated use of the `abi.decode` function on the same piece of data. Given that encoding and decoding operations in Solidity consume gas, it's generally good practice to minimize these operations whenever possible.

2. **What should I do, step by step, to fix the found gas-wasting patterns?** The solution to this problem would be to decode the metadata just once and store the resulting values in local variables. By doing this, you can avoid the need to decode the same data more than once. Here's how you can implement this:

```solidity
(bool _validQuote, bytes memory _metadata) = JBDelegateMetadataLib.getMetadata(delegateId, _data.metadata);
uint256 _quote;
uint256 _slippage;
if (_validQuote) {
    (_quote, _slippage) = abi.decode(_metadata, (uint256, uint256));
    uint256 _swapAmountOut = _quote == 0
        ? _getQuote(_data.projectId, _data.terminal, _projectToken, _data.amount.value)
        : _quote - ((_quote * _slippage) / SLIPPAGE_DENOMINATOR);
    // Rest of the code...
}
```

In this way, we decode the metadata once and use the resulting variables `_quote` and `_slippage` wherever needed. This modification will save some gas as the number of `abi.decode` calls is reduced.

3. **On a score of 0 to 5, please rate this new pattern in terms of how much it is sacrificing readability, security, and maintainability in exchange for gas optimization.**

- Readability: 5 (There is no significant impact on readability. The code is still clear and easy to understand.)
- Security: 5 (There is no effect on security. We are simply reducing the computation by avoiding unnecessary decoding operations.)
- Maintainability: 4 (There is a slight effect on maintainability. If the structure of the metadata changes in the future, the developer must remember to update the decoding operation accordingly.)

Additional requirements:

1. The prompt is clear and contains a good amount of information. However, a higher-level overview of what the contract is designed to accomplish and the role of each function could help in understanding the purpose behind certain coding decisions. This could lead to more accurate and meaningful optimization suggestions.

2. Reflection on reasoning process: The reasoning process involved understanding the functions in the contract, identifying operations that are computationally expensive, and finding instances where these operations are performed repeatedly on the same data. This requires a good understanding of Solidity and the Ethereum gas model. For future tasks, spending more time understanding the contract and its functions before starting the analysis could help identify more potential optimizations. Also, considering the larger context in which the contract operates may help identify optimizations that aren't immediately obvious from the code alone.
