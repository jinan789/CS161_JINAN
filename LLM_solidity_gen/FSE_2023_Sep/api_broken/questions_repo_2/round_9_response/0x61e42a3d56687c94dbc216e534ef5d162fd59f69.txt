The Solidity code provided is quite complex, yet I was able to identify some potential gas-optimization patterns that could be improved. This required analyzing the code for common gas-wasting patterns from the list provided and then applying my understanding of Solidity and the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) to identify less obvious patterns.

Here are some new gas-wasting patterns:

1. **Repeated computation of balance**

   **How it was found:** In the `swapCollectedTradingFees` function, the balance of the contract is computed twice: once at the beginning of the function and then again inside the `swapTokensForEth` function. The EVM has to compute the balance each time it's called, which wastes gas.

   **How to fix:** Store the balance in a variable at the beginning of the function and then use that variable instead of calling `balanceOf` multiple times.

   **Impact score:**
   - Readability: 5 (no effect)
   - Security: 5 (no effect)
   - Maintainability: 5 (no effect)

2. **Repeated computation of divisibility**

   **How it was found:** In the `updateSwapTokensAtAmount`, `updateMaxTransactionAmount`, and `updateMaxWalletHoldAmount` functions, the total supply is divided by 100000, 1000, and 1000 respectively. This operation is repeated and costs gas each time it's performed.

   **How to fix:** Compute these values once and store them in state variables. Update these variables whenever the total supply changes.

   **Impact score:**
   - Readability: 4 (slightly affected as we are adding more state variables)
   - Security: 5 (no effect)
   - Maintainability: 4 (slightly affected as we need to manage more state variables)

3. **Redundant function calls**

   **How it was found:** In the `_transfer` function, the `balanceOf` function is called both in the condition to decide if a swap can be made and then again when calculating `contractTokenBalance`. This is unnecessary and could lead to extra gas consumption.

   **How to fix:** Compute `contractTokenBalance` before the condition and then use it in the condition.

   **Impact score:**
   - Readability: 5 (no effect)
   - Security: 5 (no effect)
   - Maintainability: 5 (no effect)

To improve this task in the future, it may be helpful to have a more streamlined approach to identifying gas-wasting patterns. For example, first looking for repeated calls to the same functions, then looking for unnecessary calculations, and so on. This could make the process more efficient and less likely to miss potential optimizations.

In terms of my own reasoning process, I first looked for obvious patterns from the list provided, then examined the code more closely to find less obvious patterns. One area for improvement could be to use more systematic methods to analyze the code, such as creating a flowchart or diagram to visualize the code's execution. This could help identify areas where the code could be optimized for gas usage.
