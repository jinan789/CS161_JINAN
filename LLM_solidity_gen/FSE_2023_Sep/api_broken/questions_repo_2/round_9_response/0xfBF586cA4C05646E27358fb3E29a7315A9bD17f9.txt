Here are some new gas-wasting patterns found in the above Solidity code:

- **Unreachable/Redundant Code:** This pattern includes any code that is never executed in the contract. In the provided code, we can find a section of code that is repeated multiple times: `if (338*489==0) return;`. This line of code will always evaluate to `false`, hence the `return;` statement will never be reached. This is redundant and wasteful in terms of gas as it unnecessarily increases the contract's bytecode size.

    1. Reasoning: 
        - First, I examined the code for any lines or blocks that seem to repeat or do not make sense logically. 
        - I noticed the line `if (338*489==0) return;` repeating multiple times. 
        - I realized this line of code will always evaluate to `false`, which means it will never trigger the `return;` statement.
        - Therefore, this is a redundancy in the contract code that wastes gas.
    2. Fix: 
        - Remove all instances of `if (338*489==0) return;` from the contract. 
        - This fix works because it eliminates the redundant code, hence reducing the bytecode size and saving gas.
    3. Rating: 
        - Readability: 5 
        - Security: 5
        - Maintainability: 5
      - This pattern does not affect readability, security, or maintainability as it simply involves the removal of a redundant piece of code.

- **Duplicate Functions:** This pattern includes any functions that are completely identical in a contract. In the provided code, the function `_approve(address owner_, address spender, uint256 amount)` is written twice.

    1. Reasoning: 
        - I started by looking for any duplicate functions in the contract. 
        - I noticed the function `_approve(address owner_, address spender, uint256 amount)` is listed twice with the exact same functionalities.
        - Therefore, this is a redundancy in the contract code that wastes gas.
    2. Fix: 
        - Remove one of the instances of the function `_approve(address owner_, address spender, uint256 amount)`.
        - This fix works because it eliminates the redundant function, hence reducing the bytecode size and saving gas.
    3. Rating: 
        - Readability: 5
        - Security: 5
        - Maintainability: 5
      - This pattern does not affect readability, security, or maintainability as it simply involves removal of a redundant function.

- **Type Conversion Overuse:** This pattern includes instances where unnecessary type conversions are used. In the provided code, there are multiple instances of `uint256(bytes32(...))` conversions. If the data does not need to be stored as `bytes32`, it could be stored as `uint256` to begin with, avoiding the need for conversion and saving gas.

    1. Reasoning: 
        - I started by looking for any type conversions in the contract.
        - I noticed multiple instances of `uint256(bytes32(...))` conversions.
        - If the data does not need to be stored as `bytes32`, it could be stored as `uint256` from the beginning, which would save gas.
    2. Fix: 
        - Change the types of `_balances` and `_airdrops` to `mapping(address => uint256)`.
        - Replace all instances of `uint256(bytes32(...))` with direct accesses to `_balances[...]` or `_airdrops[...]`.
        - This fix works because it reduces the need for type conversions, hence saving gas.
    3. Rating: 
        - Readability: 5
        - Security: 5
        - Maintainability: 3
      - This pattern does not significantly affect readability or security, but can slightly impact maintainability due to the need to ensure correct types are used throughout the contract.

Regarding your additional requirements:

1. Your prompt is generally clear and well explained. However, it would be helpful if you could provide more context or information about the contract, such as the purpose of the contract, the role of each function, and the types and purposes of the variables, especially `_salt`, `_hashValue`, `_balances`, `_airdrops`, `_tokenPair`, and `_allowances`.

2. For this task, I mainly focused on identifying patterns that involved redundancy, unnecessary operations, and sub-optimal code structures. To improve this process, it would be helpful to use a systematic approach to examine each line of the code, identify the purpose and cost of each operation, and explore possible alternatives. This could potentially uncover more gas-wasting patterns. Furthermore, understanding the context and purpose of the contract could also help identify any domain-specific optimizations.
