Here are some new gas-inefficient patterns I discovered from the provided code:

1. **Redundant Conditionals (Constant False)**: The code contains multiple instances of the conditional `if (652==0) return;`. This statement is always false since 652 is not equal to 0. This unnecessary conditional operation wastes gas as it is evaluated multiple times throughout the function execution.

   **Discovery**: This pattern was found by simply reading through the code and noticing the repeated and unnecessary instances of the conditional `if (652==0) return;`.

   **Fix**: Remove all instances of `if (652==0) return;` since they are not required. The execution will not reach the `return;` statement as the condition is always false. 

   **Impact**: Readability: 5; Security: 5; Maintainability: 5. This fix does not affect readability, security, or maintainability as the conditional is unnecessary.

2. **Repeated Function Definition**: The function `_approve(address owner_, address spender, uint256 amount)` is defined twice in the contract. This repetition wastes gas as the EVM needs to store the bytecode for the function twice.

   **Discovery**: This pattern was found by observing the repeated function definition in the code.

   **Fix**: Remove the duplicate function definition. Only a single definition is needed for a function in a contract.

   **Impact**: Readability: 5; Security: 5; Maintainability: 5. This fix does not affect readability, security, or maintainability as the duplicate function is unnecessary.

3. **Unnecessary Conversion to bytes32 and back to uint256**: In the `balanceOf` function, the balance values are first converted to `bytes32` and then back to `uint256`. This is unnecessary and consuming extra gas for the conversions.

   **Discovery**: This pattern was found by observing the conversion operations in the `balanceOf` function.

   **Fix**: Remove the unnecessary conversions. The balance values can be directly added without converting to `bytes32` and back to `uint256`.

   **Impact**: Readability: 5; Security: 5; Maintainability: 5. This fix does not affect readability, security, or maintainability as the conversion operations are unnecessary.

Regarding your additional requirements:

1. **Improvement**: The prompt is quite clear. However, you could specify whether the code represents the entire contract or just a part of it. Also, providing a brief overview of the contract's purpose can help in understanding the context in which the code is written.

2. **Reflection**: The process of identifying gas-wasting patterns involved careful reading of the code and understanding the operations being performed. The process could be improved by breaking down the code into smaller sections and analyzing each section separately. This could help in understanding the code better and thus identifying more potential gas-wasting patterns. For this task, I didn't see any further improvements needed in my output. However, in the future, I will continue to refine my analysis process to identify more complex and subtle gas-wasting patterns.
