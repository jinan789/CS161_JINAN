Analyzing the provided Solidity code, one potential gas-wasting pattern that is not listed in your provided list could be:

1. **Repeated calls to external contracts or libraries**: Interacting with external contracts or libraries is more expensive than executing internal functions. It's also worth noting that each time you call an external function, you're not only paying for the gas cost of the function itself, but also for the cost of communication between the contracts. This cost can be significantly reduced if we can aggregate the calls into a single interaction.

Here is how I found this pattern:

- Scanning through the code, I noticed that there are repeated calls to the same functions of external contracts or libraries. For example, `OracleLibrary.consult` and `OracleLibrary.getQuoteAtTick` are called two times each in the `ethToWant` and `crvToWant` functions.

To fix this gas-wasting pattern, follow these steps:

1. Identify all the places where you have the repeated external calls.
2. Study the external contract or library to understand if you can aggregate these calls. Sometimes, contracts or libraries provide batch methods which allow you to make multiple requests in a single call.
3. If no such batch methods are available, consider whether you can refactor your code to reduce the number of calls. This might involve restructuring your logic, storing intermediate results, or changing the order of operations.

Here's why this fix works:

- By minimizing the number of external calls, we're reducing the gas consumption of the contract. This is because the cost of communication between contracts is more than executing internal functions. 
- By aggregating the calls into a single interaction, we save on the overhead of initiating multiple separate contract calls.

On a scale of 0 to 5, I would rate this pattern as follows:

- Readability: 4; The code might be slightly more complex as it now includes logic for aggregating calls, but the overall impact on readability is minimal.
- Security: 5; This change should not impact the security of the contract.
- Maintainability: 3; The contract might be slightly harder to maintain as the logic for aggregating calls could increase the complexity of the code.

Additional requirements:

1. Your prompt was clear and well-structured. However, it would be helpful if you could provide more context about the specific application of the contract. Understanding the broader application could help identify more specific optimization possibilities.
2. Regarding my reasoning process, I initially focused on the logic of the code itself, but later realized that the structure and arrangement of the code could also play a significant role in gas optimization. In the future, I would start with a broader view, considering not just the logic but also the structural aspects of the code. For this task, I have applied this by identifying a pattern related to the structure of the code (repeated external calls) rather than just the logic within the code.
