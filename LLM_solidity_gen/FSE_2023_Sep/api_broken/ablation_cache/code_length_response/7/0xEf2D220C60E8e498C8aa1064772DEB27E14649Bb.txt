Certainly, after analyzing the provided Solidity code, I've identified a few potential gas-wasting patterns that aren't covered in your initial list. These patterns are as follows:

**Pattern 1: Overuse of storage for intermediate variables**

Storage in Ethereum is expensive, so overusing storage for variables that aren't necessarily needed to be stored could lead to gas wastage.

**Pattern 2: Inefficient use of loops**

In the given code, there is a loop that generates random numbers until a unique one is found. This is a potentially unbounded loop, which could consume a lot of gas if unlucky.

**Pattern 3: Repeated calls to external functions**

In the loop where winners are selected, the function `transferETH` is repeatedly called. Each external function call costs gas, so it might be more efficient to batch these operations.

**Pattern 4: Unnecessary boolean checks**

Every if-statement requires a comparison operation, which requires a small amount of gas. Removing unnecessary if-statements can save a bit of gas.

---

For each of these patterns, I'll describe how they were found, how they can be fixed, and what impact the fix would have on readability, security, and maintainability.

**Pattern 1: Overuse of storage for intermediate variables**

1. Discovery: Examining the code, I noticed that the variable `cycle_` is stored in the contract storage. This variable is only used within the `openLottery` function and does not need to be kept across different function calls or transactions. 
2. Fix: To fix this, we could change this variable to be a memory variable instead of a storage variable. This way, it will only be stored in memory during the function call and will not take up any storage space. 
3. Impact: Readability: 5; Security: 5; Maintainability: 5 - This change does not affect the readability, security, or maintainability of the code.

**Pattern 2: Inefficient use of loops**

1. Discovery: While reviewing the code, I noticed the loop that generates random numbers until a unique one is found. This is a potentially unbounded loop, which could consume a lot of gas if unlucky.
2. Fix: One possible fix is to use a different mechanism for selecting winners that does not rely on generating random numbers. For example, you could use a deterministic selection process based on some attribute of the participants. Another option is to use a more efficient random number generation and uniqueness checking mechanism.
3. Impact: Readability: 3; Security: 4; Maintainability: 3 - This change could make the code a bit more complex to read and maintain, and there may be some security considerations depending on the mechanism used for selecting winners.

**Pattern 3: Repeated calls to external functions**

1. Discovery: I noticed that the `transferETH` function is called repeatedly inside a loop. Each external function call costs gas, so it might be more efficient to batch these operations.
2. Fix: Instead of making an external call each time through the loop, you could accumulate the amounts and addresses to be paid in memory and then make a single batch transfer at the end. This would reduce the number of external function calls and therefore save gas.
3. Impact: Readability: 4; Security: 4; Maintainability: 4 - This change might make the code slightly harder to read and maintain, and there might be some security considerations depending on how the batch transfer is implemented.

**Pattern 4: Unnecessary boolean checks**

1. Discovery: I noticed that there are several if-statements in the code that could potentially be simplified or removed to save gas. For example, the check `if (msg.value != 1 ether) revert IllegalOperation();` could potentially be removed if you ensure that the function is only called with 1 ether elsewhere in your code.
2. Fix: To fix this, you could remove or simplify these checks where possible. This would reduce the number of comparison operations and therefore save a bit of gas.
3. Impact: Readability: 5; Security: 3; Maintainability: 5 - This change should not affect readability or maintainability much, but it might have security implications as you would need to ensure that the conditions are checked elsewhere.

As for your additional requirements:

1. Your prompt was clear and well-formulated, but it would be helpful to have more context about how the contract is used and what its functions are supposed to do. This would make it easier to suggest optimizations that are aligned with the contract's intended behavior.
2. Overall, the process of analyzing the code for gas inefficiencies was fairly straightforward. In the future, it might be helpful to have a more formal process for identifying and categorizing potential inefficiencies. This could involve systematically going through each line of code and considering its gas cost, as well as the gas cost of any alternative implementations.
