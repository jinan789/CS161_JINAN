After analyzing the provided Solidity code, I have found two potential gas-wasting patterns that are not included in your list:

1. **Redundant Condition Checking**: In the `createGame` function, the conditions that validate the odds are checked one by one in a loop. If an invalid odds is found, the function reverts and all previous gas used is wasted.

    * *Discovery Process*: This pattern was found by looking at the code flow and realizing that all of the condition checking could potentially be wasted if a condition fails late in the process.
    * *Fix*: One potential solution is to validate all the odds first in a separate private function before creating the game. The validation function could return a boolean indicating whether all odds are valid, and the `createGame` function could then check this boolean before proceeding. This way, if the odds are not valid, the `createGame` function can exit early, saving gas.
    * *Why the Fix Works*: By separating the validation into a different function, the `createGame` function can exit early if the validation fails, thus saving gas. Furthermore, the validation function has a single responsibility, which makes the code more readable and maintainable.
    * *Impact Score*: Readability: 5; Security: 5; Maintainability: 4. The impact on readability and security is minimal, but there might be a slight decrease in maintainability due to the additional function. However, the separation of concerns could also be seen as an increase in maintainability.

2. **Repeated Access of Storage Variables**: In the `_gameStatus` function, the `game` struct is accessed multiple times. Each access to a storage variable costs gas.

    * *Discovery Process*: The pattern was discovered by examining the `_gameStatus` function and noticing the repeated access to the `game` struct.
    * *Fix*: Assign the frequently used `game` properties to memory variables at the beginning of the function and use these variables instead.
    * *Why the Fix Works*: Accessing memory variables is cheaper in terms of gas than accessing storage variables. This change will therefore reduce the overall gas cost of the function.
    * *Impact Score*: Readability: 5; Security: 5; Maintainability: 5. The variables will still have clear names and the function's behavior won't change, so readability, security, and maintainability are not affected.

As a general note, your prompt was clear and detailed, providing sufficient information to complete the task. For future tasks, it might be helpful to provide a brief overview of the purpose and functionality of the provided code, but it was not strictly necessary in this case.

Regarding my reasoning process, I started by reading through the code to understand its functionality. I then compared the code with the existing gas-wasting patterns, and finally looked for other patterns that could lead to wasted gas. To improve, I could perhaps have performed a more systematic analysis of the code, checking each function and each line against a list of potential gas-wasting patterns. However, given the complexity of the code and the open-ended nature of the task, I believe my approach was reasonable and effective.
