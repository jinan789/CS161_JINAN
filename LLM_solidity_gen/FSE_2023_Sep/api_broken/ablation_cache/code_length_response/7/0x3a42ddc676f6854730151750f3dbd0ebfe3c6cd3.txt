Analyzing the provided Solidity code, I've detected a few potential gas-wasting patterns. Below are these patterns along with explanations, fixes, and potential impacts:

1. **Excessive use of `require` statements**
    - **Discovery Process**: `require` statements are a form of error handling in Solidity. They are used to check conditions and revert transactions if the conditions are not met. Each `require` consumes gas, and if a condition can be checked without a `require`, it can save gas.
    - **Fix**: For instance, the check `require(from != to, "The donor address is equal to receive");` is repeated in both the `donateToken` and `donateERC20` functions. This check could be moved to the `_transferToken` and `_record` functions, reducing the repetition.
    - **Impact**: Readability: 4; Security: 4; Maintainability: 4. The impact on readability and maintainability is minor since the refactoring would reduce the repetition of code. Security is also not affected as the same checks are still performed.

2. **Redundant variable declaration**
    - **Discovery Process**: In the `donateERC20` function, you're declaring variables that simply hold the values of the function's parameters. This is redundant and wastes gas because declaring a variable consumes gas.
    - **Fix**: Use the function parameters directly instead of declaring new variables. For example, replace `string calldata symbol = _tokenSymbol;` with `_tokenSymbol`.
    - **Impact**: Readability: 5; Security: 5; Maintainability: 5. The impact on readability, security, and maintainability is negligible as this change only simplifies the code.

3. **Repeated call to `keccak256` function**
    - **Discovery Process**: The `keccak256` function is a built-in Solidity function for hashing and is relatively expensive in terms of gas. In the `_verifyFreeAllowList` function, the `keccak256` function is called each time the function is invoked.
    - **Fix**: If the input to the `keccak256` function is frequently repeated, consider caching the hash in a mapping to save gas.
    - **Impact**: Readability: 3; Security: 4; Maintainability: 3. This change might slightly decrease readability and maintainability due to the additional complexity of caching, but it doesn't affect security.

Regarding your additional requirements:

1. Your prompt was clear and detailed. However, it would be more helpful if you could provide a little more context or background about the contract's purpose. This would help to better understand the importance of certain operations and the potential implications of optimizing them.

2. My reasoning process involved understanding the purpose of the code, identifying repeated operations, and looking for unnecessary statements. To improve, I could delve deeper into the logic of the contract and consider the frequency of certain operations. As for improvements to my output, providing specific code examples for the fixes could be beneficial. This would offer a clearer understanding of how to apply the suggested optimizations. For example:

    Instead of the existing code in the `donateERC20` function:
    ```solidity
    address from = _msgSender();
    string calldata symbol = _tokenSymbol;
    bytes calldata message = _message;
    address token = _token;
    bytes32[] calldata merkleProof = _merkleProof;
    uint256 amountInDesired = _amountInDesired;
    address to = _to;
    ```
    It could be optimized to:
    ```solidity
    address from = _msgSender();
    ```
    And use `_tokenSymbol`, `_message`, `_token`, `_merkleProof`, `_amountInDesired`, `_to` directly in the subsequent code. This change eliminates the unnecessary variable declarations, saving gas.
