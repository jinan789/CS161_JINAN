Sure, I can certainly help you identify potential gas-wasting patterns in the provided Solidity contract. Let's dive in:

**Pattern 1: Redundant SLOAD operations**

The `SLOAD` operation in the Ethereum Virtual Machine, which is used to read the contract's storage, is one of the most expensive in terms of gas consumption.

1. *The Discovery Process*: While examining the `newVote` function, I noticed that the `applications[_tick]` object is repeatedly read from storage multiple times. This constitutes an unnecessary repetitive use of the `SLOAD` operation. The same pattern appears in the `withdrawNewVote` function.

2. *The Fix*: Create a local variable to store the `applications[_tick]` object, and use this local variable instead of directly accessing storage. This reduces the number of `SLOAD` operations and therefore gas usage. Additionally, write the changes back to storage at the end of the function execution if necessary.

3. *Impacts*: Readability: 5; Security: 5; Maintainability: 5. This change doesn't affect the readability, security, or maintainability of the code.

**Pattern 2: Redundant condition checks**

Redundant condition checks may also increase the gas usage without providing any benefit.

1. *The Discovery Process*: Looking at the `deposit` and `withdraw` functions, they both check the allowance and balance of the `msg.sender` before performing a transfer. However, these checks are unnecessary because the `safeTransferFrom` function already checks these conditions.

2. *The Fix*: Remove the unnecessary `require` statements. The `safeTransferFrom` function will automatically reject the transfer if the conditions are not met, so there is no need to check these conditions again.

3. *Impacts*: Readability: 5; Security: 5; Maintainability: 4. Removing these checks will not affect the readability or security of the code, but it may make the code slightly less maintainable as developers may need to remember that these checks are performed implicitly.

**Pattern 3: Inefficient use of storage for booleans**

1. *The Discovery Process*: The `Application` struct contains two boolean variables (`passed` and `undeployed`). However, each boolean variable in Solidity occupies a full 256-bit word in storage, which is inefficient.

2. *The Fix*: Consider packing these boolean variables into a single `uint256` or `uint8` variable by using bitwise operations. This can save storage space and thus gas.

3. *Impacts*: Readability: 3; Security: 5; Maintainability: 2. This change can make the code less readable and maintainable because bitwise operations are generally harder to understand than simple boolean operations. However, it doesn't affect the security of the code.

Improvements for your prompt:

1. Providing a more specific scope for the task could help. For instance, if only specific functions or parts of the contract should be optimized, mention them explicitly.
2. Clarify the trade-offs acceptable for the task. Gas optimization often comes at the cost of readability and maintainability, so stating the acceptable level of compromise upfront can guide the analysis.

Improvements for my reasoning process:

1. A systematic approach to the analysis can help identify more patterns. For instance, start by looking at storage operations, then move on to computational operations, and so forth.
2. Keeping an up-to-date knowledge of the Ethereum gas pricing model can also help. The cost of different EVM operations can change depending on network upgrades, so being aware of the current costs can help identify more gas-wasting patterns.
