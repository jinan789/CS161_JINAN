I've found two potential gas-wasting patterns in your code. These patterns are not on the list you provided, therefore should be considered new. 

**Pattern 1: Repeated External Contract Calls** 

1. The first pattern I identified is the repeated external contract calls to `IPool(ADDRESSES_PROVIDER.getPool())`. External function calls are expensive in terms of gas, especially when the address of the contract is not known at compile time. This is because the EVM has to do more work to look up the contract and its code.
2. You should store the result of `IPool(ADDRESSES_PROVIDER.getPool())` in a local variable at the beginning of each function where it's used and then use that local variable for subsequent operations. For example, in the `getUserReserveData` function, you could modify the code as follows:

```solidity
IPool pool = IPool(ADDRESSES_PROVIDER.getPool());
DataTypes.ReserveData memory reserve = pool.getReserveData(asset);
DataTypes.UserConfigurationMap memory userConfig = pool.getUserConfiguration(user);
```
   
   This way, you're only making the external call once, and reusing the result, which should save some gas.

3. Readability: 5 (The code is just as readable as before); Security: 5 (The security is not affected by this change); Maintainability: 5 (The code is just as maintainable as before, and might even be slightly more maintainable since there is less repetition.)

**Pattern 2: Redundant Array Initialization for Known Constants**

1. The second pattern I found is the redundant array initialization and assignment for known constants in the `getAllReservesTokens` function. The `reserves[i] == MKR` and `reserves[i] == ETH` checks can be optimized by pre-assigning the known constants at the time of array initialization.
2. You could pre-compute the values that you know at compile time and assign them directly in the array initialization step. For instance, if you know that `MKR` and `ETH` are always in the `reserves` array, you can assign them directly at the time of array creation like so:

```solidity
TokenData[] memory reservesTokens = new TokenData[]({
  TokenData({symbol: 'MKR', tokenAddress: MKR}),
  TokenData({symbol: 'ETH', tokenAddress: ETH})
});
```
   
   Then, you only need to loop through the remaining tokens in the `reserves` array and assign them as you were doing before. This should save some gas because you're not doing unnecessary computations for the known constants.

3. Readability: 4 (The code is slightly less readable because someone might not immediately understand why MKR and ETH are being assigned directly); Security: 5 (The security is not affected by this change); Maintainability: 4 (The code is slightly less maintainable because if the MKR and ETH addresses change, or if they are not always in the reserves array, you will need to update this code.)

**Reflections**
- **Improvements in the Prompt**: The provided code snippets are written in a high-level, abstract way, which makes it a bit difficult to come up with concrete gas-saving strategies. Providing a more concrete example, or more context about what the contract is meant to do, could help in identifying more potential optimizations.
- **Improvements in the Reasoning Process**: I tried to look for the most obvious gas-wasting patterns first, such as repeated external calls and redundant operations. However, some potential optimizations might only become apparent with a deeper understanding of the contract's functionality. Therefore, next time, I could try to understand the contract's functionality more deeply before starting the optimization process.
