Sure, let's dive into the Solidity code and find new gas-wasting patterns.

New Gas-Wasting Pattern 1:

- **Unnecessary checks in function calls**: In the code, we see that the length of the `sig` parameter is being checked in the `betaDelegatedTransfer` function. This check is not necessary if the function is always called with a signature of length 65. This uses extra gas for every call where this condition is true.

Answers to the following questions:

1. I found this pattern by closely reading the code and understanding what each line does. When I saw the check for the length of `sig`, I realized that this validation is not necessary if the function is always called with correct parameters. This is a common pattern in Solidity contracts where developers often include many checks to ensure the correctness of the parameters. However, these checks consume extra gas when conditions are true.
2. The fix is simple, remove the check for the length of `sig`. This will save gas for each call where this condition is true. However, this fix will work only if we are sure that the function will always be called with correct parameters. If this is not the case, removing this check might introduce bugs in the contract.
3. Readability: 5; Security: 3; Maintainability: 5. Removing this check will not affect the readability and maintainability of the code. However, it might affect the security if the function is not always called with correct parameters. Therefore, this optimization should be done carefully.

New Gas-Wasting Pattern 2:

- **Repeated use of `keccak256` hash function**: In the `initializeDomainSeparator` function, `keccak256` is used twice, which is an expensive operation in terms of gas usage.

Answers to the following questions:

1. I found this pattern by noticing the repeated use of the `keccak256` hash function in the `initializeDomainSeparator` function. Hashing operations are generally expensive in terms of gas usage, so repeated use of them can be costly.
2. To fix this, we could calculate `keccak256(bytes(name))` once, store it in a variable, and then use this variable in the `abi.encodePacked()` function. This would mean the `keccak256` function is only called once, reducing the gas cost.
3. Readability: 5; Security: 5; Maintainability: 5. The readability, security, and maintainability would not be affected by this change. It merely reduces duplicate computation and thus saves gas.

As for the additional requirements:

1. Your prompt was clear and well-structured. However, it will be more helpful to have some specific goals or targets for the gas optimization. For example, you could specify that you want to reduce the gas cost by a certain percentage. This would make the task more concrete and allow me to focus my efforts more effectively.
2. To improve my reasoning process next time, I would start by running the code through a gas analyzer tool to identify the most costly operations. This would provide a starting point for the optimization process. In terms of improvements for this time, I have already identified and explained two new gas-wasting patterns and how to fix them. These improvements will save gas without sacrificing the readability, security, and maintainability of the code.
