The provided Solidity code is quite well-written, but there are a few potential gas-optimization improvements that could be made. Here are two potential areas where gas could be saved.

## Gas-Wasting Pattern 1: Excessive Repeated State Variable Access

### Explanation

Every time you access a state variable in your contract, you're using gas. In the `createStream` function, you are accessing the `_nextStreamId` state variable twice. The first time is to set the `streamId`, and the second time is to increment it. 

### How to Fix

To rectify this, you could store the `_nextStreamId` in a local memory variable, increment it there, and then store it back to the state variable. This way, you only access the state variable twice (once for reading and once for writing) instead of three times.

```solidity
// Original Code
uint256 streamId = _nextStreamId;
_nextStreamId++;

// Optimized Code
uint256 streamId = _nextStreamId++;
```

### Impact

- Readability: 5 (no effect)
- Security: 5 (no effect)
- Maintainability: 5 (no effect)

## Gas-Wasting Pattern 2: Unnecessary Storage of Variables in Memory

### Explanation

The `CreateStreamLocalVars` struct is used to store the intermediate variables `duration` and `ratePerSecond`. This is unnecessary and wastes gas, since these variables are only used once and could be computed in-place.

### How to Fix

You can remove the struct and compute the values directly in-place. 

```solidity
// Original Code
CreateStreamLocalVars memory vars;
vars.duration = stopTime - startTime;
require(deposit >= vars.duration, 'deposit smaller than time delta');
require(deposit % vars.duration == 0, 'deposit not multiple of time delta');
vars.ratePerSecond = deposit / vars.duration;

// Optimized Code
uint256 duration = stopTime - startTime;
require(deposit >= duration, 'deposit smaller than time delta');
require(deposit % duration == 0, 'deposit not multiple of time delta');
uint256 ratePerSecond = deposit / duration;
```

### Impact

- Readability: 5 (no effect)
- Security: 5 (no effect)
- Maintainability: 5 (no effect)

## Prompt Feedback

The prompt was quite clear in its request. However, it could be helpful if you provided a more extensive Solidity code sample or multiple code samples to analyze. The provided code sample was relatively short and well-optimized, which made it difficult to find many areas for potential gas optimization.

## Reflection

To improve my reasoning process, I would consider looking at a wider variety of potential gas-wasting patterns in Solidity code. For example, I could look at patterns related to the use of loops, conditionals, and function calls. Additionally, I would consider the specific context of the code in question, as some gas-wasting patterns may only be relevant in certain scenarios.
