Examining the Solidity code provided, one potential gas-wasting pattern can be identified:

1. **Redundant external contract calls:** External contract calls are expensive in terms of gas. In the code provided, there are multiple calls to the `_pool` contract's `getConfiguration` and `setConfiguration` functions. This can be optimized if the configurations are read once and written once in each function.

   - **How did you find this pattern?** I found this pattern by scanning the provided code for repeated external contract calls. Each time a contract's function is called, it consumes gas. If the same function is called multiple times within a function, it can lead to excessive gas consumption.

   - **What should I do, step by step, to fix the found gas-wasting patterns?** The solution to this issue is to reduce the number of calls to the `_pool` contract. This can be done by calling `getConfiguration` once at the beginning of the function, storing the result in a local variable, making the necessary updates to this variable, and then calling `setConfiguration` once at the end of the function to update the state in `_pool`. This ensures that we only make one call to `getConfiguration` and one call to `setConfiguration` per function, reducing the gas cost.

   - **On a score of 0 to 5, please rate this new pattern in terms of how much it is sacrificing readability, security, and maintainability in exchange for gas optimization.** 
     - Readability: 5; The changes suggested do not affect the readability of the code. The code remains as understandable as before.
     - Security: 4; The changes do not introduce any additional security risks, but we need to ensure proper error handling and revert in case the `_pool` contract calls fail.
     - Maintainability: 4; The changes are straightforward and do not introduce complexity that could make future maintenance difficult. However, developers need to be aware that contract state is being updated at the end of the function.

As for the feedback on the prompt:

1. **Prompt Improvement:** The prompt was clear overall, but it would be helpful to have a brief summary of what each function in the provided Solidity code is supposed to do. This will help in better understanding the context of the code and potentially identifying more gas-wasting patterns.

2. **Reflection on the reasoning process:** My reasoning process involved examining each line of code and checking against the list of known gas-wasting patterns. I then looked for other patterns that could be potentially wasteful in terms of gas. One improvement I could have done was to consider more in-depth the business logic of the contract, which may reveal other less obvious inefficiencies.

In the future, I would also consider the potential trade-offs between gas optimization and other important factors like security, readability, and maintainability before proposing changes.
