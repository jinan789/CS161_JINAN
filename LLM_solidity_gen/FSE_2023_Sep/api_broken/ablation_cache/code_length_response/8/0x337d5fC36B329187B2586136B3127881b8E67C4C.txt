Looking at the provided Solidity code, we can identify a few more gas-inefficient patterns. Note that some of these patterns are not necessarily "new" in the sense that they are unheard of, but they are not listed in your provided list and are present in your code. Here are a few:

1. **Repeatedly calling the same function**: The function `_etherPrice()` is called twice in the `liquidation` function. Each function call consumes gas, so it would be more efficient to call the function once and store the result in a local variable if it's needed more than once.

- **Discovery process**: I noticed that `_etherPrice()` is called twice in the `liquidation` function, which could potentially be a gas-wasting pattern.
- **Fixing process**: To fix this, you could simply introduce a local variable to store the result of the `_etherPrice()` function and use that variable in the subsequent calculations. This would avoid the need for a second function call.
- **Impact**: Readability: 5 (no significant impact); Security: 5 (no significant impact); Maintainability: 4 (slightly less maintainable due to the introduction of an additional variable).

2. **Unnecessary calculations in condition checks**: In the condition `etherAmount * 2 <= depositedEther[onBehalfOf]`, the multiplication operation uses more gas than a division operation would.

- **Discovery process**: I noticed that the multiplication operation in the condition check could be replaced with a division operation, which would use less gas.
- **Fixing process**: You could replace `etherAmount * 2 <= depositedEther[onBehalfOf]` with `etherAmount <= depositedEther[onBehalfOf] / 2`. This would use less gas because division operations cost less than multiplication operations in Solidity.
- **Impact**: Readability: 4 (slightly less readable due to the use of division instead of multiplication); Security: 5 (no significant impact); Maintainability: 5 (no significant impact).

3. **Unnecessary use of storage**: In the `liquidation` function, the `reward2keeper` variable is stored in storage but it could be stored in memory instead, since it's only used in this function and doesn't need to persist between transactions.

- **Discovery process**: I noticed that `reward2keeper` is stored in storage but only used in this function, which is inefficient in terms of gas usage.
- **Fixing process**: You could declare `reward2keeper` with the `memory` keyword to store it in memory instead of storage, which would use less gas.
- **Impact**: Readability: 5 (no significant impact); Security: 5 (no significant impact); Maintainability: 5 (no significant impact).

As for your additional requirements, your prompt was very clear and provided enough information for me to work with. However, it would be helpful if you could provide the rest of the contract code or at least the definitions of the variables and functions used in the provided code. This would give a better understanding of the context and make it easier to spot any potential gas-inefficient patterns.

In terms of my reasoning process, I initially focused on the specific gas-wasting patterns you provided, but then realized that there could be other inefficient patterns not listed. By broadening my focus, I was able to identify a few more potential improvements.
