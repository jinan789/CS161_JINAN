I have gathered a documentation that introduces the gas usage of Solidity. I would like your assistance in analyzing these documents to identify potential misalignments between gas optimization strategies and typical coding practices.

Please note that misalignments can occur between gas optimization strategies and typical coding practices, because while developers often focus on writing clean, readable, and modular code, gas optimization may require certain trade-offs or deviations from these typical coding conventions. For example, in some cases, optimizing gas consumption may involve avoiding certain language constructs or patterns that are otherwise commonly used for code readability or simplicity. This could include reducing the number of iterations in loops, minimizing the use of expensive computations or storage operations, or avoiding redundant calculations.

Therefore, I need your help to read through the documentation and find any gas-related concepts that are different from common coding practices and could be utilized to optimize gas usage. In other words, please review the provided gas usage documentation and help me uncover any instances where gas optimization techniques may conflict with conventional coding approaches.
