I want you to help me combine some gas-wasting patterns for Solidity. Those patterns are what I have found, and I have made several rounds of improvements on them. Each round has one output set of patterns, and now I want you to help me combine those patterns into one report that serves as a one point of summary.

Please note that the output in each run is separated by the [*****&&&&&^^^^^%%%%%$$$$$] deliminator, where they may have duplicate across different runs.

Overall, here are the requirements of the summarization:
1. The input patterns could have duplicates, please combine duplicates into one.
2. The input patterns might not have the same format. Make sure your output contains the same layout format.

Here are a list of the patterns I found:
